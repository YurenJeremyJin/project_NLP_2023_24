Was offered a bit more than other companies and I priced out 5+ companies.  Josue was responsive and good to deal with. Would be 5 stars but the communication from the 3rd party towing service lacked a little. I wasn't expecting it to happen until at least the next day but they called me just a few hours after I accepted the deal for selling my truck and said they were 10 minutes away. Had to rush home and get what I needed cleaned out of it.  Overall not a bad problem to have as it was a good thing to get rid of it.,24 avril 2024,4

Then I tried car brain and they offered me $400! And their associate Josue was with me from start to finish giving me updates all the way up until there tow company was able to come pick up the car.

"I was definitely impressed comparatively speaking to the other companies that are out there with their professionalism. However, the fact that they tout that they offer free towing as well as title transfer as a bargaining tool when I wanted more for my car than they were asking by only $140.  The towing wasn't free and neither was the title transfer as was listed on the check that I received when they picked up my car, albeit in a timely manner.  It clearly states a total of $575 - $125 for the car removal and then $90 for the title. How is this free? I feel like they misrepresented that and for this I would never use them again. Don't say it's free if it's not. If they had told me out right the reality of it all I probably would have delivered the car myself because it was drivable. Their communication was excellent right up until the moment when they knew that they had the car and it had been taken away.  I haven't heard from anybody since even though I reached out. Christian, as great as he was failed to respond and follow up when I asked about the above stated issue.  Just like any salesperson he had what he needed.  I question many of the reviews on here because of that.",16 avril 2024,2

When there was a glitch with my title, they hung in there while I got it straightened out.Cons: estimate went from $350 to $150 without explanation.

Wouldn't hesitate to use them again.,16 f√©vrier 2024,5
"It was super easy to set up my pick up online, and I was offered a better deal than I was expecting (and more than offered when I directly called a local place). I was partnered with a local company, which I liked, and it was easy to set up my pick up time with them. Communication with Leilani was friendly, timely, and helpful! She made the process as simple as can be! Thank you!",22 f√©vrier 2024,5

"CarBrain was surprisingly lovely to deal with, especially as a femme who doesn't know much about cars!Josue was my file manager and he was persistent, patient, and kind. He made it very easy for me to just text him the details about my car, and gave me a pretty decent offer ($595, which was $50 higher than the instant offer I got from Peddle). I appreciated how he reached out by both email and text message, and was completely in sync with whatever I'd put into the website.I could certainly have made more money by selling the car privately, but I didn't want to deal with all that would have involved, since my car was on Planned Non-Operation for 4 years.They paid me via Cash app and also offered Venmo. It took a bit longer than I expected to have the company come to pick it up, but everything went smoothly and the pick up person was also very kind (especially about me becoming emotional saying goodbye to my trusty old friend).Only things I'd say to consider:- Check online to see how long your offer is good for, because when I looked online it was good for a couple days longer than I'd been told verbally.- CarBrain has a car marketplace if you want to go through CarBrain but sell for a higher price than their offer. If I'd known that earlier, I probably would have wanted to do that (seems easier than selling via eBay / FB Marketplace / etc).- I had some technical glitches with the website, where it wouldn't let me enter a confirmation code. Hopefully they'll fix that, but the customer service was so excellent that it didn't impede me too much.",19 mars 2024,5
Everything that is advertised is exactly the way the experience turned out.  In today's world honesty and great customer service is a very positive experience.  I recommend everyone to your company if the want to sell their vehicles as I did.,15 f√©vrier 2024,5

"They called many times asking me if I accepted the offer and I told them I had. Then 3 times they said they would pick it up then ignored my calls. They don't keep their word and are very clumsy. Took a hundred dollars less for cash for cars to come and get it, which they did 2 hours after I called them and did it 2 hours earlier than they said. That's the place to call",09 avril 2024,1

They were honest and easy to work with. The tow truck person called an hour before he showed up just like they said.

Using CarBrain to get rid of our running but high mileage car was quick and easy.

Their level of professionalism, efficiency, respect for their customer and overall customer service cannot be beat! I could not find room for improvement within my experience if I tried! This was my first time working with CarBrain. I had never heard of them as I stumbled upon them by chance on FB. Without doing a background check or look at customer reviews, I jumped in with both feet thinking I didn‚Äôt have a lot to lose. I couldn‚Äôt have been more impressed with the service this company provided me with. Erica was there with me to roll out my transaction from start to finish. Between her expertise and her amazing level of proficiency, my only role in the transaction was to show up with my car‚Äôs title, keys and collect my check. Oh, I got more than a fair price for my old car!",24 janvier 2024,5

"The classic deceitful dealer; do not trust them. Their non-existent ""evaluators"" will interestingly provide the same amount as any other instant offer service while masquerading as a real go-between for you and local dealers. Whether or not they will take your car away without hassle doesn't matter; their deceptive tactics guarantee that you will not get what you deserve for your vehicle. Do not trust them!",24 janvier 2024,1

"Eddison and CarBrain were exactly what I needed when my old minivan gave up the ghost. A $3000 repair to the transmission didn‚Äôt make any sense on a vehicle worth less than that price tag. I filled out several online questionnaires for selling a vehicle for scrap. All of them asked similar questions and gave me an offer in exchange for my contact info. CarBrain had the best offer by over $100. Eddison stayed in touch with me, but struck the balance between that and being pushy and overbearing. All my questions were answered, and the sale took place without a hitch, even though the vehicle was a decent distance from my home. Glad to get something for a vehicle that wasn‚Äôt fully operational and had lots of years and miles on her.",19 janvier 2024,5

"Difficulty coordinating with the car towing outfit sent to pick up car.  Carbrain took care of it. Then got a play by tow truck driver to try nickle-and-dime price down for invalid reasons.  Ultimately, he gave up and paid approximately what was agreed to (maybe $10 less).  Got it done.  Other than that, it was a relatively painless process.  I would recommend Carbrain, but gave 4 stars because the pick up process was cheezy b.s. that reflects badly on otherwise straightforward process.",13 janvier 2024,5

I felt carbrain rep. was non-existent for support when I needed him the most. Carbrain 3-stars. CoPart 5-stars. Split the difference between the two, overall rating 4-stars. Thanks to all in the end.

"CarBrain endorses third party tow companies to re-negotiate their guaranteed quote at the time of pick-up.I was completely honest with the condition of my one owner truck.Driver arrived and immediately offered me only $50.Related CarBrain offer was $395, he shook his head and laughed. Then through his translation app, gave me a long list of reasons why he was not paying CarBrains quoted price.I refused, he called the CarBrain office, twice in the 2 hours he was here and said a $100 offer was firm.After 2 hours of going around and around with the driver I began to feel intimidated by him.Believing that CarBrain had change the offer I accepted, reluctantly. He refused to give me a receipt nor sign the Title.Contacted CarBrain and they said he did not call them and he must have been speaking with the towing company, washing their hand of any commitment or promise.I insisted that I wanted my truck back...but of course it had been stripped for parts.CarBrain offered me a $50 gift card, which I refused as they would not honor their $395 promise.CarBrain endorses the third party towing companies to low-ball their customers and refuse to make it right.Cheated me out of  $295 GUARANTEED  quote.Do not do business with CarBrain, they hire third parties to knowingly cheat you with their permission.",08 d√©cembre 2023,4

"We were able to negotiate the price that CarBrain would pay me for my vehicle.  Having the title and waiting for the towing company to get it was very much timely as discussed with CarBrain.  The driver called his boss to make sure that they could accept the, because there was no where for me to sign off on it.  Being from Ohio that's just the way they make their titles.  The lady who the driver called verified that my title would suffice and my car was soon on the flatbed being carted off.  I was paid in cash and not charged for the tow. This is the second time CarBrain has done right by me.  I have a couple more cars to scrap so I will be calling them back soon.  I have to get a title for one of my cars which is coming from Mich.  I look forward toy next couple of experiences with CarBrain.  I truly and have recommended CarBrain to family, friends, church members, etc.  Love you CarBrain.

"I went out line to fill out their form to sell my deceased father's clunker.  They made and offer which I accepted.  When we spoke in person they said they could not offer the price we agreed to.  We were scheduling the pick up.  It appears as though their operation is 'give a great price then do the bait and switch and say the price was reduced, but they can still come out and buy it for the lower price.  It was more than a 10% price reduction.  That's not a small reduction.  Stay away.  A lot of wasted time.  They are not worth it.  Found another place that offered more than original.  Would never do business with CarBrain.UPDATE:  A manager contacted me shortly after my review and agreed to honor the original price.  They provided an explanation that I accepted, but I found another company to purchase the car.  They tried to make the best of a bad situation.  So I will withdraw my 1star review and give them a 3-4 star for their effort and willingness to correct the problem they created.",02 novembre 2023,2

Carbrain, on the other hand was transparent in their offer at the very beginning and honored it. Jesus Mendez, with Carbrain, answered all my questions and did great follow up both during and at the conclusion of the sale.

"I would give ZERO stars if it let me. I had a HORRIBLE experience with this company CAR BRAIN and SOOWYS the company that issued me the BAD check and towed my car away.  Basically they lied all along that this wasn't a SCAM. IT IS A SCAM. The check they wrote me BOUNCED! This was a HORRIBLE DISASTER I spent many days on the phone and I took off work to meet them when they were going to pay me, which they never showed up.  It is a criminal offensive to willing write a BAD CHECK. In the end I did get my money CASH 5 DAYS LATER.  They should have just paid with CASH when they towed my vehicle away.  After all this running around and stress I WOULD HAVE DONE THIS TOTALLY DIFFERENT HAD I KNOWN THEY WERE GOING TO RIP ME OFF.  Donate your car would be a SMARTER CHOICE. These companies should be ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES.  THEY ARE THIEFTS. DON'T USE THESE COMPANIES THEY ARE LIARS.",31 octobre 2023,5

"CarBrain offered the highest amount for my 29 year old, non running car. It was hard to let my car go, since I had put a lot of love, and money into it over 25 years. They even offered to help me sell it for more on their own platform. In the end, they offered more than the 7-10 other companies that I tried to get offers from. They also provided the free towing service for my car, and it was parked on the side of the driveway. The only reason that I cannot give a 5 Star rating, is because I had a lot of difficulty understanding some of the phone operators. Some of them had very strong accents, and seemed like they were in different countries. That was less than favorable. Otherwise, I appreciated getting my check when my car was picked up, and it clearing my bank when I went.",19 octobre 2023,5

I contacted them on the 25th and accepted their offer, which a female agent verbally confirmed over the phone (this is called a ""contract""). We then moved to the next stage of the sale in which I sent in my title information, where to leave the check, etc. They told me to await a text message from their dispatcher for the exact pick-up time, and I did.Well, I never got the text message, so I e-mailed them the next day, and then the next, asking what was going on. Oops, they didn't want to pay the original amount anymore; they wanted to reduce it by 20%! Something something ""market value."" No, sorry, my car didn't lose 20% of its value in 24 hours, and also, you had an agreement with me, so stick with it.Bottom line: they didn't honor the offer they gave me and then lied to me when I confronted them about it. Don't waste your time with Carbrain.EDIT: They replied with, ""Please reach out to us at [email] and a manager will contact you as soon as possible and look into your file."" Yeah, right.

When they came to retrieve the vehicle I was told the catalytic converter was an aftermarket one and they shorted the amount by $150. From all the reviews I'm seeing, there seems to be a pattern of being told the catalytic converter is ""aftermarket"". I had mine fixed not long ago and from what I understand, it was welded but my mechanic never stated they changed it entirely or used an aftermarket part. I spent ALOT of money fixing it so it doesn't seem accurate that it is aftermarket. I was already doubting it but now after seeing all the reviews saying the same thing this seems to be a way to shorten the amount originally offered to clients.",18 ao√ªt 2023,4

"I have never junked a car before and was nervous about finding an honest company.  Several of the most popular and frequently used auto recyclers in my area have numerous bad reviews (in excess of 50 within the last 3 months both online and through the BBB).  The complaints were always the same:1)	Tow company not showing up at the stated time.2)	Lowballing the offer.3)	Paying much less than the agreed upon offer even though the car was in the condition the owner stated at the time of the quote.4)	Handing out bad checks.One of the companies actually called me after I submitted my request and stated my vehicle had a lien so they were reducing the price by $300.  I have a clean title; I paid off the car 3 years ago.  The title is clean.  They re-entered my VIN and continued to claim it was showing a lien.  Obviously, this was not true.The other company was going to give me $50 more than Car Brain, but I had to find and contact the tow company myself and arrange for the pick-up (My undrivable car was at the repair shop.)  This company did not find a lien on my vehicle.  Then a little while later they sent a second offer via email with a lower offer.Once I submitted my info to Car Brain, I got an immediate response via email.  I went with Car Brain for one reason:  EDDISON!  He was terrific!  He fully explained their process and to ease my discomfort with junking my car, he offered to contact the tow company himself and make all of the arrangements for them to pick it up at the repair shop.  All I had to do was sign the title and send him a photo of it.  I then took the title to the repair shop and told them the amount of the check I was to receive.  The tow company arrived at exactly the time they promised, the check was for the full amount, and it cleared.  What a relief.There is no way this would have gone so smoothly without Eddison.  He was in constant contact with me via phone and text.  Despite my many concerns Eddison was honest, caring, and very patient.  I highly recommend Car Brain and urge you to request Eddison personally.  His integrity and professionalism will serve you well.Thank you Eddison for a stress free experience!",19 ao√ªt 2023,5

"On August 10, 2023 I looked up carrying and they told me they would give me 570.00 for my car, but that's not what.i got. I got 370.00 which is a rip off, the company they use out of Orlando is the worst. They send a Spanish speaking man, I don't speak Spanish. They loaded my car and he gives me 380 and takes off before you can count the money. Call the tow company and they say the cadalic converter was missing, which it wasn't, and a lot of damage underneath, which wasn't the truth, I asked them to bring my car back and I'd return the money cause they ripped me off, so when a car brain Representative from car brain called I told them I didn't get what I was told was what the car was worth. He told me there investigating the tow company now cause I guess the company has gotten 3 other people saying they got ripped off by the tow company too, well in the mean time me and my family is out 190.00, All carbrain can say is were sorry and there investigating the tow company.But want me to give carbrain another chance. I don't think I'll trust them again. And it's too bad cause I now have another vehicle that isn't working and needs to be towed, but I can't trust this company. If carbrain would have said we're sorry and let us give you the 190.00 you lost, then we'll just sue the tow company to get are money back, but nothing but I'm sorry and give us another try.

"It took this online offer app less than 5 secs to tell me that while they had an offer on my car, it didn't meet their standards. I suppose this is because the vehicle won't start.I chose this site because their ads stated that they bought junk cars. While my car is not junk, it hasn't been driven in several years, so it will not start without some work. The exterior, interior, engine & tranny are all fine, so I don't get this.Oh well, a waste of time. Oh, and I didn't even get a reference # to submit.üòí",30 juin 2023,5

They are on point.  They ask you all the pertinent questions regarding the car you are selling and really make sure all is ok with it to avoid issues for them and for you.  They made a fair initial offer which changed after they ask about the catalytic converter.  But it is understandable.  That is a valuable part of the car and without it the car loses value.

"I was selling an operating car with damage to the rear driver-side fender and back light. The cost of repairs exceeded the Blue Book value of the car, but the car was drivable and in good condition otherwise, with 111,000 miles on it.I tried several web sites and got bids ranging from $700 to $1,250.I was skeptical because nobody asked me to provide pictures of the damage and because I had a Texas title but the car was registered in Nevada. I did not want to be in a situation where the deal would be retraded at pick up time.I told Kevin that I wanted to send pictures of the car so he could see before we sealed the deal. He gave me clear instructions about what pictures to send, and confirmed that as long as I had clear title to the car, the origin of the title did not matter.After I had sent the pictures, Kevin increased his bid by about $200 and I accepted.The car was picked up within 2 days by a local company that delivered a check for the amount agreed upon in exchange for the car, the title and the keys.The entire process took a week.To recap, Kevin made it easy for me, answered all my questions, execution went according to the agreed upon terms, on a timely basis, with no negative surprises. I had a very positive experience and I would recommend the company to my friends.",03 juin 2023,5

"The process with Edison was very good. I didn't have the physical title, and he continued to follow up with me to ensure a smooth process. Once I completed the full paperwork process with the title, that is when things took a turn for not such a good turn.The pick-up was quick. The driver called and informed me that he was 25 minutes away. Once arrived I provided him with all information, however, I was surprised that he did not ask me for proof of ID. It wasn't a concern, but then it dawned on me that someone could sell a car and as long as the title is signed the car could be picked up without the true owner being aware that it was sold. Once I received the check, I contacted Bank of America to verify the funds. The business account listed on the check; the automatic system stated that the account number could not be found. I made the driver of the tow truck aware, and he contacted Angela in the local office (Jax, FL). I was able to conference her on the line to hear what Bank of America states about the checking account number. She stated that she doesn't know why it would say such a thing since her payroll is drawn from the same checking account and if it was any issues with her pay, she wouldn't be working there. Once I went into the house, unaware of the driver my office faces the street that the vehicle pick-up was taken on. I believe that Angela gave him a call back, and unknown to him my home cameras captured the audio of the conversation on his end. Not pleased and would rather not repeat the captured audio. However, I would say this. Just as anyone would do, I wanted to verify the legitimacy of the check. That is not something to make fun of or mock. It was poor customer service, and maybe the driver and Angela should express a bit of empathy when dealing with customers versus mocking anyone or you can leave the mocking for in-person conversations to prevent being captured on Camera audio and visual.I spoke with my bank and they assured me that if anything is captured with the check that is provided that they will notify me of the return. I was left with an uneasy feeling about selling my vehicle and provided a check with an account number that the bank validation line doesn't recognize.If it is any issues with the check, I will update the review page and inform viewers. Lets truly hope that I am worked over nothing and that the local individuals here receive customer service training to some extent.",26 mai 2023,5

The guy called me at 3 pm said is it ok to come over to get the car. Two hours later still they are still not here!!!! The time window I was given to pick up the car was 12 pm - 5 pm. This is ridiculous enough. I then get a call at 5, yes 5 pm, after waiting 5 hours it is going to take another hour! What?!?!?! This is how you treat your customers.

"First of all this whole process was foreign to me. I had never had to sell a car like this before. Mine was wrecked and totaled. The Car Brain team from the original starting rep getting all my information about my car to person that actually helps facilitate the buying was really good. My Rep Orlin was a great help to to me and stayed in good contact throughout.The only issue I have with the process is that they rely on IAA (Insurance Auto Auctions) all around the states to help coordinate the car pick up and tow. This is where the process may break down for you depending on how on the ball your local IAA business is. These tow truck drivers are individual contractors and make their own hours and are not entirely beholden to the IAA or your schedule even though they give you a time window for pick up. My window was not met and it was a pretty decent inconvenience for me since I had already planned it during my work day so when they told me the pick was actually not happening until the next day I was not a happy camper.  And when I called the IAA team the girl there was always frustrated that I was calling to check on things and I only called 3 times in two days which I thought was reasonable considering.However, once the towing company finally called me, way later then expected the next day, they were really nice and kept in contact with me from that point on. The pick up and trading of my paperwork for the check was very smooth. The final step will be to get a bill of sale from Car Brain so I can go to my local county clerks to make sure the car is no longer in my name.",07 avril 2023,5

"BAIT & SWITCH. (BBB has similar reports)I filled out everything about the vehicle online they wanted.  They replied with an offer.They came out and offered 30 % LESS, with no plausible explanation. Perfectly good driveable car, far from junk. They didn't even need their tow truck.This is several hours after the transaction, having some time to think of the experience. Of course I didn't have to accept, and in hindsight, I shouldn't have.  We're only talking about $100, but it's the same crap people have to go through buying & selling their vehicles. Even scrap metal dealers seem to be the same.It's damn near impossible to find people who will even honor what they put in writing.Moral of the story?  Don't be surprised if they show up and offer you nothing near their written offer.CARBRAIN:  ASK MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CAR B4 MAKING AN OFFER.

Carbrain is an amazing company! I was eeally skeptical at first but erica the agent I worked with put my mind at ease.She walked me through the process step by step.She always kept me informed and was on top of things. I sold my car in a week and when the driver of the towtruck came to pick up my car he reminded me i had  to remove my license plates from the car which he did for me. I would definitely use them again.great experience starting from erica to the driver who picked up my car!,13 d√©cembre 2022,5
It was very easy to use Car Brain from start to finish.I always knew what was going to happen next.,14 d√©cembre 2022,5
"I found CarBrain online and was hesitant to use an out-of-state company until I read several reviews. Once I contacted them, Mr. Mendez shot me a quote same day. I wanted to shop around some local scrap yards for pricing and it took a few days to get quotes back that did not come close to CarBrain's price. Once I agreed to CarBrain's quote, they sent me a name & number for a local company to pick up my car and they ended up contacting me first. They wanted to come the next day but our schedules did not accommodate that time slot and we agreed on a few days later. The local company called ahead, the tow driver had the paperwork and cash as agreed. We produced our own bill of sale which the driver signed for us before releasing the car. The process took no more than 10 minutes - cash in hand/car gone... If you're looking to get rid of your car quickly and with a friendly experience from everyone involved, CarBrain is your answer.",17 d√©cembre 2022,5

"They were very easy to work with and patient. They worked around my schedule,too.  It took a couple of months to get it finalized but I was pleased with the ease of the experience.",07 d√©cembre 2022,5
Very easy transaction. Fair price,06 d√©cembre 2022,5
Kevin called back several times to check up on the process. They seem efficient the process was explained and occurred as planned. It did take an extra day for them to get the tow company out to get my car - but that was a different company that seemed less efficient - but still completed the job.  My one complaint is that no-one mentioned anything about the License plate. It stayed on the car - but Im not sure if I was supposed to take it or tell the DMV that its no longer my plate?  They could have helped with that.  I have parking linked to that plate that I needed to cancel too.  Just an update: I called about the license plate and they mailed it back to me. Great Service.,22 d√©cembre 2022,5

Told me they would pick up the car today.  Said the driver would call an hour ahead of time.  Never got a phone call. I started calling dispatch late in the afternoon.  That was the first i heard that it might be well into the evening.  Even that was a lie.  Driver called at 5:30pm and said he would call around 7 pm so I could drive 60 miles and meet him at the car.  It is now 9:17 pm crickets.  I don't have 13 plus hours to sit around for a driver that may or may not show up.  This has been a nightmare.,07 d√©cembre 2022,1

Signing over power of attorney for the car was a bit unnerving because that part hadn't been explained to me, but it enables a quick transfer without having to go anywhere. My only real challenge was uploading photos, which wouldn't complete when I was using firefox. After switching browsers, it worked fine but that suggests the site uses cookies that I may or may not want.",17 novembre 2022,4

"They are misleading. Even though the car is used.....everything has to be original or you get $300. I bought it used from DealTime and it was a 2005 Cadillilac CTS! They have you send in pics and Vin then they give an offer which is subject to change when they get their to tow. First offered $600then they dropped it to $500 when I said I would look around they called me back and said they will honor the $550.....they knew what they were doing. If your car was not new when bought then go somewhere else because they are misleading and not forthcoming.... shady dealings, Trust and believe me!!!!!Don't want this to happen to any anybody else who need money to survive.

Carbrain stated that they bought unwanted cars and trucks for cash $. Being curious I called up ,and talked to a lady named Erica, and explained to her about my old jeep, and what was wrong with it, and how it could not  move on its own power. She made me a offer of cash money, site unseen. She was friendly and helpful. And promptly dispatched a driver to pick up the vehicle. I really didn't have any thing to lose on the deal, and gave me the opportunity to see a company that in fact do, exactly what it said it would do. The tow truck driver was on time, and made his  inspection. Took a few pictures of the vehicle, and made a cash offer ,and off he went.

You call, they ask many questions not asked on initial offer and lower your offer; tell you initial offer expired, or learn you have sold some items and they now say the car is ""stripped"", so they can't make as much money and then back out of the offer.  A scam company that does not honor it's offers.  BMW 2001 740 I, no wheels, no catalytic converters, no damage to car.  Engine inoperable.  Offered $375; accepted, then asked questions.

"Carbrain,Initial experience w/Carbrain employees was very good, each time I reached-out someone responded.  However, during vehicle verification process ( title did not clearly define single lien holder) there were repeated calls to the company and correspondence forwarded to John that were NOT acknowledged or followed-up with by John or members of  the company. Post initial discussion John seemed absent or too busy to respond  and finally after resolving title issue, vehicle payment was fwd to incorrect Coparts (Apoke Fl office) and had to be FedEx over weekend to company nearest my home Decatur. Long story short 4 days later we received payment. In summary I would say company did a good job however, someone must follow-up with customer and verify payment is sent to correct party.

I actually bought this vehicle from this same dealership in 2013.Finally, when the dealership got tired of keeping my vehicle I got a call from their service reps asking me to get my car out of their parking spot as soon as possible before they start charging me. I was not happy. To make a long story short, I went online and come across CarBrain. You guys assisted me so quickly and within two days, my car was out of the dealership car lot and your offer was pretty good.

"My 93 Honda was my first vehicle and before that was my dad‚Äôs car since 93. I learned how to drive in it, and learned about the road. There was a lot wrong with mind and I knew that, I didn‚Äôt know how bad it was but it still kept chugging along. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I messed up a lot on it myself, but it kept going‚Ä¶ but it being an old vehicle meant not only was more coming apart, it‚Äôs parts were getting harder to find and expensive, plus things with me were also making things worse. Then the engine no longer worked, I figured I‚Äôd replace it, but there were still cost after that so I decided to sell it.The came the biggest problem, selling a car that doesn‚Äôt start. I wouldn‚Äôt get much for it outright, then how would I get it there? I DuckDuckGo places and I tried a few places, then came CarBrain. I was attracted to them because not only did they advertise for cars that didn‚Äôt start, THEY offered to pick it up. I was a little greedy at first the offered 400 at first and I wanted to hold out for at least 525. You gamble sometimes and win, others you lose, but even then, I ended up selling at 200, yet they still let me repost and try to get higher. I didn‚Äôt lose the one buyer and they let me try for more, no one bite (this time 425) and let me take the 200 offer after days of trying. Everything went quick afterwards, that day the towing company they partnered with was on the phone with me and I got it towed the next day. Got the money right as I handed the title, they even went out of there way to help with my last mistake‚Ä¶ I left my plate on. When I couldn‚Äôt reach the person who was towing it, I called CarBrain and they followed up and spoke to the towing company and arranged to get my license plate back, got it back that day.The only two mistakes were on my part (trying to go for more and forgetting my plate) but they were patient and worked with me on both. I always knew the last lesson my Honda would teach my was my parting with it, thanks to CarBrain, it went well.",06 mars 2022,5

"I liked the ease of use in the process. Especially the time it took to get an offer on the car. This being my first time in this process I was not sure if this was a bonafide offer but as I went through the process found it to be so.  I did have some difficulty in connecting with Carbrain,s rep but that was resolved. The only issue I had was when requesting an increase in the initial offer I had to take pictures of the car which was inconvenient for me at the time.  I also appreciated the company coming through with my request to pick up the car a day earlier than was initially scheduled.Thanks,John",06 f√©vrier 2022,5

I got an offer for my car on carbrain and I accepted it. The day of pickup and payment I called several times asking what time the tow truck would be there. They kept telling me 30 minutes. I discovered that the tow company removed my car without my knowledge. When I called carbrain they tried telling me they didn't come. What was the reason they didn't show up like planned or why wouldn't they call to inform me they wouldn't be there?? Needless to say they got my car I didn't receive payment. But I still have my title and contacted the police. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!!!!,05 f√©vrier 2022,1

"Aside from the incredibly low offer, I can‚Äôt describe my experience as anything other that dealing with scavengers.Not only was the offer low, but the first question about the car was ‚Äúdoes it have it‚Äôs catalytic converters?‚Äù So very clearly just that part alone would net carbrain more than double the offer.They know one is in a jam when dealing with this company, and they take FULL advantage.Lastly, I was very clear (confirmed 3 times with the scheduler) about pick up time, and whom to contact, and not only did they miss the entire 4 hour window, but they proceeded to contact the WRONG number. I‚Äôm doing so, delaying pick up by almost 12 hours.It is what it is when one is in a position to have to steep to using this type of service, but at the very least, they could make their offers more fair, and AT LEAST be on time, or WITHIN the 4 hours pick up window.I would never recommend this company to anyone, and and sorely disappointed and dissatisfied with the entire ordeal. It‚Äôs a shame. Truly a shame.",28 janvier 2022,1

"The whole process was quick, efficient, and I didn't have to pay anything.I was initially just looking for a quote but I had an offer for the car within the day before I was even ready to get rid of it. And ultimately (when I was ready) it paid more than a trade in with a dealer would have gotten me. Not necessarily the best solution for getting rid of any car but it was the best solution for me.Trade in offers for my car were at/around $200. I managed to junk it with CarBrain for $325. I could have set it up for other auction/offers to potentially get paid more... but ultimately I just needed that car gone. It was quick (almost too quick) and simple. I highly recommend it.",13 d√©cembre 2021,5

The timing chain on my car broke, sizing up the motor. I was told by several mechanics the most I could get for my car at a local junk yard was $500. CarBrain offered me more than twice as much. I had misplaced the title to the car and had to obtain another one from the State Motor Vehicle office, which took several days. CarBrain worked with me and held the price. They gave me a time when the car was to be picked up. The tow truck driver was courteous and after handing him the title, he handed me a check fore the agreed upon price.

"I had a 2007 Acura TL with almost 205,000 miles; the body was straight, paint was in good shape and it had just a scratch on the rear side.  Mechanically, the car was drivable but had some issues.Although I was hesitant to use CarBrain I felt it didn't hurt to see what they had to offer, especially after reading their testimonials, which showed vehicles in far worse shape than mine was in and the former owners receiving, supposedly, $850 to $1200 and more, not to mention, I assumed that Acuras were more highly valued.After it was all said and done, I agreed to their offer of $255.  Yep, $255.  To be honest, I no longer had any use for the car and couldn't wait to remove it from my driveway and delete it from my insurance policy.I can only attribute their lowball offer to my car's relatively high mileage, but I only have myself to blame, for falling for CarBrain's slick advertising and selective testimonials (assuming the testimonials are real and not fake).To their credit, I will say that the communication between us was excellent, and they let me know of the status of my transaction all the way.There is certainly a value for such a company as CarBrain, and I would not rule out using them again.  My anticipation vs. actual outcome in my first transaction was not what I expected.  Sure, no one forced me to sell my car to CarBrain, and certainly I over-expected, but it was a bit disappointing.",09 septembre 2021,5

"After our engine blew in our car and the repairs were too costly, CarBrain was the answer to our prayers.  If we would have tried to sell our car ourselves we would have been lucky to get $100.

I highly recommend CarBrain.",03 septembre 2021,5

Well everything went well until the day that was scheduled for the vehicle to be picked up. I took the day off from work and had a pick up scheduled between 12:00 and 4:00 and at 3:50 I had not heard anything so I called the company that was supposed to be picking up the car they said the driver was running a little late. So I waited until 5:20 still heard nothing so I called back I was told that they will be picking it up the next day between 10:00 and 2:00 and I told them that I could not take off from work again and that the earliest I could be there was 4:00 and when I got there at 3:50 the car was gone!!! And I still had the title and they had my check. So I called them and they said that yes they picked up the car and I asked about the check and they said that they will try and get the driver to meet me to give me the check and I can give them the title. And eventually it was worked out but I was pretty disappointed that it got so difficult at the end.,01 septembre 2021,5
This company was great. Worked with me on my price. Then it was such a easy process,01 septembre 2021,4

I love Car Brain. The process was fast and easy.,01 septembre 2021,4
The overall process was super easy.  I was totally skeptical at first but it was a legit process.   The problem came with the vendor actually picking up the car.  It took 2 weeks and me calling 25 times.  They may need a different tow company if they want a better process.  Once it got resolved it was fine.   So much easier that selling to an individual.,01 septembre 2021,5

"It was pretty easy. My car had broken down enough to where I didn‚Äôt want to put any more money into fixing it. They bought it with messed up parts and all. They asked for pictures (of the car, my ID, and title), and for the title to be signed to them when they came. The emails and phone calls where all timely and polite and they also got a tow truck out to my house in two days which was a free service. Although they told me it would be cash upon pickup, it was a check and there were ‚Äúmiscellaneous fees‚Äù when I cashed it at my bank. I was quoted $750 and walked away with about $726 after cashing it. All in all, they bought my broken car, I got a good quote, the process was pretty easy, the responses were polite, and the pickup was quick and timely. I would recommend!",27 ao√ªt 2021,5

My only issue is the company they used in my area to come and get the car.  Car Brain's site said that they'd collect the vehicle within 3 days - that's not what happened.  The earliest that the company they used could get the car was a week later, then they didn't make the appointment.  I had to call and reschedule and then they were 6 hours late for that.  Once they were there though everything went well.  The tow driver took the title and gave me a check then took the car away.  Again, Car Brain is great, iid have given a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the tow company in my area that they contract with.",18 ao√ªt 2021,4
Easy and fast.  I was able to get a quote for my truck and we worked out an acceptable price.  It was picked up with no issues with a check in hand.  Professional and expedient service.  If you have no choice to get rid of a vehicle that you can't sell or drive or donate.  Use them.,18 ao√ªt 2021,5
"Smooth process, organized, expeditious",18 ao√ªt 2021,5

CarBrain pulled thru with picking up my vehicle via a tow truck and issuing payment relatively fast. I would recommend to anyone needing to sell a non running car. My only complaint is would be it required me to ask all the right questions to understand the process fully versus CarBrain explaining everything in detail.",17 ao√ªt 2021,5
ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!! From start to finish!!! Easy and FAST! Met me and a local tow truck company hooked up the car and handed me a check after verifying my ID. So simple! Was my local bank too on the check!!! I HIGHLY recommend CarBrain!!!!,17 ao√ªt 2021,4

There was confusion between carbrain and company actually picking up car over date and time to come pick it up.

I was looking forward to driving my car for years and being car note free.  Car Brain offered me a decent price for my shell of a car, Katie never rushed me into making the decision to sell.

We expected to get a couple hundred from a dealer, maybe a couple hundred more selling it ourselves, but basically only enough to cover the cost of towing and the shop's bill. A quick Google search landed me at Carbrain and while I was skeptical I filled in the information and talked over the details with one of their reps (communication was rather sporadic and start-stop but we got what we needed). In the end they picked up our car from the shop and we got a check right there for a thousand over what we thought we'd get for it somewhere else.Carbrain helped us make the most out of a sucky situation!",05 juin 2021,4

"I was skeptical at first because it sounded too good to be true. After doing some research and reading many 5 star reviews, my skepticism quickly turned into pure excitement! The engine in our 2015 Range Rover Evoque seized after missing just 1 oil change. It was in very good condition inside and out with 90k mikes. The dealership where we bought it offered us $4000 on a trade-in. We thought ‚ÄúWhat the heck?‚Äù and then said ‚ÄúNo thanks‚Äù! I found CarBrain online and within 24 hours they came back with a $6000 offer. I countered with $6500 and they accepted. We sent the requested photos, title etc. We actually found the second remote key fob and I countered again with photos of them as they are worth a couple hundred each and they gave us another $250! They came to the dealership, where we left the vehicle, with a tow truck and handed us a check for $6750, which cleared the next day! A fast, easy, & reliable company with super nice employees to boot! I feel like I won the lottery finding them! Don‚Äôt hesitate!

The only thing I was dissatisfied with was that it was very hard to hear anything over the phone when I was talking to a representative. It sounded like there were a lot of people yelling in the background and I constantly had to ask the representatives to repeat themselves. It happened with all of the people I spoke with over the phone (two or three different people).,02 juin 2021,5
I give them 5 stars. We couldn't get the van to start and the other car on the tow truck wouldn't come out of gear. The driver managed to get the van on the tow bar and towed it away,02 juin 2021,4
Fairly easy to receive an offer and simple process as long as you have a title.  I would suggest a little more details on title transfer process.   Pickup from the third-party group was fairly simple as well although the driver was delayed by about 4 hours but no issues once arrived.,02 juin 2021,5

I contacted a local company and was surprised the low ball amount  they where willing to pay. After doing some research I made a account with CarBrain, received an offer in minutes & they picked up my car the next day. Super easy and the agent that helped me with process was professional & friendly. The next afternoon a guy picked up my car and handed me a check on the spot for way more then the other company offered. $200 vs $768 CarBrain was definitely the winner. No waiting on the money or waiting for a check in the mail. It was an awesome experience! My brother in law is getting his old pickup towed by CarBrain this week.

We made an appointment for the car to be picked up (date and six hour time slot) but the driver didn‚Äôt show and we had to reschedule for another time-but then THAT driver didn‚Äôt show. We almost decided to give up on it, but called to reschedule again and let the dispatch know (again) what was up. Third time was a charm-two days after the original appointment the Tow truck showed up in the time allotted, handed us our check for the signed title, and we waved goodbye to our car in the sunset.

If I can offer any advice to carbrain: Maybe do research on the tow companies you use and make sure there‚Äôs better communication between the two parties. I now have to sit and wait in the house all day and maybe all day tomorrow when I could be doing something productive. Edit: So they replied almost instantly, and they called the next morning and got a tow truck and a check to my house in the next hour. Not only that but they also sent me an e-gift card for the inconvenience. They went above and beyond.",07 mai 2021,5

"Great experience that started as a bad situation. Was going to be a considerable amount of money to repair our vehicle. Worked with CarBrain to get a fast, respectable offer to buy out our car.",04 mai 2021,5
This was my first experience with CarBrain - I was concerned when the tow truck driver would not provide any identification  - and when asked - he was abrupt and said he could just leave and not take the car. An ID representing the tow company would have been sufficient... as well as some paperwork indicating the transaction other than a check.I just ended up taking photos of the tow truck and license plate - and hoped for the best as they drive away with my vehicle. Maybe having a conversation with the individuals CarBrains rely on to interact with customers to complete the transaction in a different manner will offer a customer a better experience. This was the only disappointment.It did end up legitimate and worked out -,04 mai 2021,4

"Our experience with CarBrain went very smoothly! We were paid what the initial online quote said it would be, which was significantly more than 2 different mechanics told us we could get from a salvage yard/pick and pull. The only hiccup we had was that we must have entered the VIN # incorrectly (0 instead of an O) so we had to verify the VIN with a picture of it off of the car. Our car was not running and not at our house so we had to make an extra trip to the mechanic where it was. Just some advice - have a picture of your VIN just in case.Overall, a great experience!",03 mai 2021,5

Another add ""peddles"" offered me $600 but turned me down when my name wasn't on the title. I was frustrated until I called this one. The receptors me it was worth it if I put the title in my name. If I did they would give me $1250.00. If I didn't I would get $600. He just didn't turn me down! I transfered the title to my name. It was worth the $80.

My only choices are junkyard, donate for full value, or sell the parts individually on Ebay or Facebook Marketplace.  Googling and I stumbled upon CarBrain.  After sleeping over what to do, CarBrain was the least hassle for me.  I'd probably double what they offered me by selling parts but the headache is not worth doing.",18 mars 2021,5

"My father fell ill in October 2020 and we needed to sell his old, unregistered car before it would inevitably be towed away resulting in impound fees. Alvaro was helping us to obtain the title replacement when my father suddenly died. Due to his death, the DMV would no longer replace the title until 40 days after the death of the person and with personal visits to the DMV. During this time, Alvaro kept in touch and provided guidance on next steps. When we finally got the title 3 months later, Alvaro renegotiated for $300 more from the buyer thanks to us now having the title and within 3 days, the car was sold and I had a check in hand. Alvaro was kind, helpful, consistent during the 3 months, and made this process as easy as possible during a very difficult time in my and my sister's lives.

"Bad at the end.  The company assigned to pick up the vehicle did so without letting us know they were there, as a result we did not remove the license plate or our toll road transponder.  They had to send someone else to meet us to hand over the payment check.  Additionally, when the issues of the license plate and transponder to sent to our point of contact with CarBrain, we received no acknowledgement or response on what to do.  I get it that we were told to ensure we removed everything, kinda hard to do when they take the vehicle without allowing us to do so.",09 mars 2021,2

At first i was like a bit nervous not knowing if this was really legit but after reading some of the reviews i felt a bit more at ease.Let me tell you that my over all experience was more then i ever imagined and I'm very happy with the entire process as it was easy as 1,2,3.1. Try to enter as accurately the car info on website .2. Wait for your offers.3. When your satisfied with the offer, accept it and CarBrain will sent you the  information on whom to call to make arrangement to pick up the car.Simply have the title in your hand the tow operator will fill it out for you and tell you where to sign the title then hand over your payment.I accepted my offer yesterday and left my details for the car to be picked up today. This morning the tow operator called me and within a reasonable time he arrived. I was likely enough to be given cash instead of a check right on the spot.

Horrific service??? Said they would pick up my vehicle between 8 AM and 12 PM had to reschedule my oncology appointment for my cancer treatment at 12:45 call me at 11:55 and said they would be an hour late is this the kind of service you can expect from this company contracting out to a third rate vendor they should be ashamed of themselves!!!!!,28 janvier 2021,1
Overall my experience with carbrain was good. They showed up handed me the cash. Pretty simple and quick process. However when they showed up the driver tells mw he has to check the catalytic converter and then says it is not thw original and drops the price by 100 dollars. This is something they could've mentioned may be an issue before hand. I may look else where when selling cars in the future.,27 janvier 2021,2
"Everything works great no issues, great customer service",27 janvier 2021,5
I couldn't believe how quick and easy the experience was and we got way more for our old truck than we thought we would get.  The whole process only took 3 days and the tow truck driver gave me a check for the truck when he picked it up.  Would highly recommend if you're looking to get rid of an old vehicle.,26 janvier 2021,5
Using CarBrain was very easy and quick.  When I needed to talk with a human to answer questions they were fast and friendly.  My daughter's Corolla bit the dust and was not worth repairing.

And I drove 20 minutes to the garage where the car was located each of those times.  They were always friendly and apologetic, but that did not make up for my frustration.",25 janvier 2021,5
"CarBrain made an upsetting situation quick and painless for me.  My car was hit on the driver's side. The cost to repair it would've cost more than I paid for the car.

The next day driver handed me the check, I handed him the title and the keys, transaction completed. CarBrain gave me the best offer, they were professional and courteous.

"The process was unbelievably easy.  I started the process with a simple Google search, 'how do you sell a used car'.  Up pops CarBrain.com and I was intrigued by the potential convenience, especially since I had the clean title in hand, so I went to carbrain.com.  At inception I realized this might be to good to be true as I responded to the three simple questions asked and I had a quote of how much carbrian.com would pay for my vehicle and the check for payment would be in-hand by the next day and the car would be taken away.Well, that is exactly what happened. Simply amazingly simple.  I cannot recommend CarBrain.com enough.",22 d√©cembre 2020,5

"I originally found car brain during an Internet search for companies that buy junk cars or cars with blown engine‚Äôs. I submitted my information and very shortly there after I got a quote for about a little more than half of what I owed on the car. But since it had a blown engine that was definitely better than the hundred dollars or $200 I get from the local junkyard. I made a lot of inquiries and search the Internet to make sure that car brain was legitimate. And although I still had some doubts I went forward. In fact when I called my bank to handle some of the financial dealings withGetting the car paid off, they thought CarBrain was a scam as well. Well guess what it turned out they‚Äôre not they are legit. They came and picked up the car they sent the money as they said they would and All was good.

When I submitted more detailed info, CarBrain offered me a higher price than the initial estimate. I also checked with some local salvage companies and CarBrain's price was significantly higher. CarBrain made it extremely easy - the towing company showed up later that day with a check in hand and took my car away.",21 d√©cembre 2020,5

"Car brain was really easy to use, the communication was simple and they followed through with what they said.",19 d√©cembre 2020,5
"The name CarBrain didn't instill a lot of confidence that this was a reputable company, but I did the due diligence and sold my 2018 Kia Forte that was declared a total loss when it was rear-ended in August 2020. Everything was professionally handled. All communication, the appraisal process, actual sale, delivery of the check and removal of the car from my driveway was prompt and seamless.CarBrain is like a broker, and the actual purchaser was a national salvage company, trading on the NY stock exchange, so I had little worry about the check clearing. CarBrain provides an option for a direct sale based on an appraisal including the seller description of the condition of the vehicle and supporting photos, or placing the vehicle on their site for other, potentially higher bids. My experience was excellent. The staff I spoke with was well trained and the communication was extremely prompt. I might suggest rethinking the company name, but based on my experience I would absolutely recommend them for anyone trying to sell a car quickly, easily and for a fair price.",19 d√©cembre 2020,5
"Great sevice, very easy process, thx again guys.",19 d√©cembre 2020,5
"The whole process was really easy and simple. Filled out form online and they will contact you using email and give you an offer. After I accepted the offer someone contacted me and scheduled a tow truck pick up, this is done through a third party so in my case there was a missed schedule by one day but carbrain was able to resolve it. You won‚Äôt get the most money out of your car selling it to them but if you want to avoid the hassles selling it to a private party, I would recommend them especially if your car is junk, they seem to give better value than your local scrap yard. They also have an option to sell your car for you in their network if you choose to go that way but I am not sure how that goes. Overall if you just want to get rid of your junk car and be done with it, I would recommend you give them a try and see what they can give you.",19 d√©cembre 2020,4

"My name is L. Jenkins. This is the worst car selling experience üòí that I ever had. I intillially was told they would buy my vehicle for $905. After they purchased it they changed their tune, to pay $650. These people are vultures. I will never do business or recommend their services again. They first told me to deposit the check, like everything is ok, and then without my knowledge, they canceled the first check. They had my vehicle,my title,keys, and I was left holding a voided check. They all of a sudden claimed the vehicle was not in the initial condition of which I explained. I do not recommend this company. There are other companies that will pay you a fair price. They will respond to this review with some vague response. The Truth is the Truth.",19 d√©cembre 2020,1

i could have gotten $600 or more for my car than i did.  i let it go for $400 when i shouild have gotten at least $1000.  the person i dealt with pushed me into a decision way earlier than i should have.  you would think that the minimum buy-out would effect his commission but i guess he's straight salary.  if he is a commissioned sales rep he screwed himself out of a commission.  i won't be using you again,15 d√©cembre 2020,5
Car brain was easy to use and showed up when they said they would.  I would have preferred a higher amount than they gave me but wanted the spot in my driveway.,15 d√©cembre 2020,1

I asked my cousin what he knew about selling a car to the junkyard and he told me to google ""What can I do with my car with a blown engine"". Enter CarBrain.com.  It was so easy. I entered some basic information, spent less than a day emailing with a representative and before I knew it I had a check handed to me by the tow truck driver who picked up the car.  I hope I never have a car I have to junk again but you had better believe that if I do this is how I will do it.  I expected to get about $200 from a junkyard and CarBrain blew that away!

"The initial process went fine with receiving a fair offer for our vehicle. I called a few other junkyards and CarBrain offered a much better price & was willing to pick up a vehicle that didn't run for no charge.The only challenges we had were with the local tow company that came to pick up the vehicle. The tow driver was supposed to call me when he was on his way to the dealership (where the car was waiting) so I could meet him there. I had the title and he had the payment check. The driver never called (apparently he didn't speak much English). The service dept. knew the car was being towed, so when he arrived, they let him take it. I called the dispatch to find out when they were going to pick up the car & was told it had already been picked up. I still had the title, but not the car or the check, so it took a lot of back & forth and the driver eventually met me back at the dealership to finish the transaction. It ended up taking quite a bit longer than it should have.",24 octobre 2020,4

Fast and efficient transaction.Polite customer service.The check cleared.Thanks.,19 octobre 2020,5
I had an excellent experience with this company.  I was not pressured to make a decision about my car.  The made me a cash offer and an offer to sell at a higher price in time.  I chose the option to cash out I needed to get a different car and wanted the cash now to get another car.  Two days later after checking with the BBB I decided to go with this company.  They showed up the next day with a tow truck and check as promised.  I also feel they gave me a fair price for my car.  I have already told many people about this excellent service.,19 octobre 2020,5
Simple and quick.  No hassle and I would do it again if I were in a similar circumstance,18 octobre 2020,5
"Smooth, fast and fair transaction.",18 octobre 2020,5
CarBrain offer me more money for my car than a junkyard would pay you I checked with for junkyard submit after they gave me was $300 for my car I have a 2012 Chevy Cruz the ring and values were blown out,18 octobre 2020,5
Super simple process and was very pleased.,18 octobre 2020,5
Overall the experience was good. There was a little bit of confusion on the back end regarding the mailing of the check but it seemed to be with the local buyers and not with Carbrain specifically. Overall I was very satisfied with my Carbrain experience.,18 octobre 2020,5
My experience selling my Jeep through CarBrain was great. I received quick responses to my requests and lots of help and guidance throughout the transaction. The driver arrived exactly  on time to pick up my vehicle and kept me informed right up to delivery at the destination. I had a very positive experience  with CarBrain and would do business  again with this company.,18 octobre 2020,5

"Using Car Brain was so easy. You send them vehicle info and take some pictures. If you accept their offer, you schedule a pick up and you hand over keys and title and they leave a check. It was quick and painless! I would definitely recommend",17 octobre 2020,5
"I was skeptical at first, but I did a lot of research first, and carbrain.com turned out to be a lifesaver. My car was damaged and the brakes needed work. No dealer would give me anything for a trade. I got $1200 for it through carbrain within a few days and didn't have to worry about transporting it anywhere. I recommend to anyone with a difficult-to-sell vehicle.",17 octobre 2020,5
"Carbrain was so easy!  It was hard watching my old girl go, but the professionalism of the staff and tow driver made things a little easier.  All I had to do was enter in basic info about my 4runner, and I was done.  I would definitely recommend them.",17 octobre 2020,5
"Great experience, easy to use, and excellent communication.",17 octobre 2020,5

"CarBrain is a great company to work with. I filled my old car information online and gave them few photos , then they gave me an offer which was the highest from other online website.  I accepted and they arranged the tow truck to pick up my car and handed me the check.  Simple and efficient.  I would use carbrain again to sell my old car.",17 octobre 2020,4
So simple and Fast! My representative that helped me was direct and helpful. Car was picked up and I had a check in hand within days of first contacting them. Took the anxiety and stress out of trying to find a buyer and haggle pricing. Got top dollar for a car with body damage.,17 octobre 2020,5
This was the easiest way for me to sell my car. Service was great. Fast and efficient. Have suggested to others.,17 octobre 2020,5
My experience with CarBrain was excellent.  I got a great offer for my vehicle.  When i decided to take the offer I was given clear instructions on how to proceed that were simple and easy to follow. The local company that handled the pickup with me kinda got wires crossed but 1 call to carbrain and it was taken care of.  Tow truck driver came on schedule got the title annd key and handed over my check.  It was much easier and quicker than i expected it to be.  From the first contact I made until I had my check was 4 days and it was only that long because I called on a Friday afternoon.  Excellent job from start to finish.  I highly recommend using carbrain to all my friends and family and I will definitely use them again.,17 octobre 2020,5
"I needed my vehicle out of my apartment parking lot. I got a quote from CarBrain, they were very friendly and helpful. Got the pick up set up right away and got paid when they picked up my vehicle. If I ever have another vehicle I'd definitely use them if I need it removed. I highly recommend using them very honest and fair prices for vehicles.",17 octobre 2020,5
Will use Carbrain again and would tell friends and family rate them 100%.,17 octobre 2020,5
"The process went much faster then expected, and the car was picked up in perfect timing!",17 octobre 2020,5
"The process was fast and easy. A very smooth transaction. Initiated the process on Tuesday, 9/15/2020 and they just picked up the car this morning, Thursday, 9/17/2020 with check in hand. The only downside was that the pickup window was 1-5pm and they called at 8:30am to say they would be here between 10-10:30am. Luckily I‚Äôm working from home, so it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. Would definitely use CarBrain again!!",17 octobre 2020,5
"My car was located at my brothers cottage over an hour north of my home, So I wasn't able to schedule a weekday pickup. Yet the company assigned to pick up my car kept calling saying we are in your area (the car location) we can pick up the car. # times this happened each time I explained that the car was an hour away from my current location. So I took a friday off from work for the arranged pickup. A 9 to noon window was arranged.  Noon came and went no truck had come, so I call the number I had to contact the driver. The number was to the companies dispatch, they said that they would contact the driver and put me on hold, and I lost the cell signal or they cut me off. I called again, same as before and I lost the signal, or? I then call Car brain they said that they would contact the company and get back to me, they did not. I called Car brain again the agent said that they would contact the pickup company while I held. They came back on the line and said that the pickup company wasn't able to make the pickup that day, but could on tuesday. I informed them that I did not live at the location of the car and I would be an hour south on tuesday. To which they offer a unattended pickup (I leave the signed title and keys in the car and they would pickup the car and mail me the check in 7 to 10 business days.) I told them I would leave keys and when I received the check I would send them the title. They responded that they don't work that way. And I made a comment that I saw how they work and If that wouldn't work for them that I couldn't complete the transaction. I  relayed all this information to Car brain, to which they responded that was how their pickup company wished to deal with their customers. I left for home after this back and forth. Total expense - one PTO day wasted ( 11 hours travel and sitting time total).",04 septembre 2020,1
"I was not sure how this would work, but ended up being a fast and very easy process and had no problems having my vehicle picked up and receive payment.",31 ao√ªt 2020,5
Car Brain offered me the highest bid on my car. The documents needed were clearly stated and information was given on the initial call. The towing company called as they promised and was on time picking up the car. I wish I knew Car Brain before. I am satisfied that they gave me true value for my car.,28 ao√ªt 2020,5
"The process was simple and hassle free.  If you have questions, they respond quickly.  My vehicle was picked up within a few days of agreeing to their quoted buying price, and a check was written to me for that amount at the time of vehicle removal.  You may make more selling it privately, but that's not guaranteed.  You must also take into account any other fees and DMV paperwork that you must file if selling it privately; CarBrain takes care of it for you.  The amount offered is fair, and in my case, worth it.  I would recommend CarBrain for anyone who doesn't want the headaches associated with selling a car on their own and doesn't/can't use their car for a trade-in.",28 ao√ªt 2020,5
"The agency provided good service, but they were unable to match my offer.  The rep also made the paperwork and transaction as simple as possible.  The tow service was great and able to pick up the vehicle promptly.My rating reflects an unmatched offer. however both the rep and tow service were courteous and professional.",28 ao√ªt 2020,5
I found CarBrain on line and truthfully thought that it was some kind of  scam.  I was wrong.   The people that worked with me were very professional and help get me through the process.   Once I got started it was just a couple of days before the transaction was complete.   I received what I thought was a very fair offer got the check the day they picked up the car.   It was a smooth process and I thank you,26 ao√ªt 2020,5
Simple to do and got more for the car than if I traded it in.,26 ao√ªt 2020,3
Professional. Gave a good price compared to competitors. Moved quickly. Would recommend,25 ao√ªt 2020,4
"Edit:  The original review (below) was a mistake on my part. I was working with a couple different dealers on a new car, and confused the company names. The review originally posted was NOT intended for CarBrain. I had a very satisfactory experience with CarBrain. I received a fair deal for my (totaled) car, received a check on the spot when they picked it up, and can highly recommend them to others. My sincere apologies for getting this wrong initially.Original Review: Dealer that YOUR site led me to immediately jacked up the price on the vehicle as soon as I expressed interest. You should consider screening dealers to weed out the charlatans and shady operators.",25 ao√ªt 2020,4
Awesome experience would recommend to everyone,22 ao√ªt 2020,5
"I didn't know this existed, but it was perfect timing for my need to sell my vehicle.  I appreciate the simplicity of the sale and the payment was immediate as well, so that was helpful.  I recommend using CarBrain to everyone now!  Thank you for a seamless transaction.  I hated to sell my car, but it needed more repairs on it than I could afford to maintain.",22 ao√ªt 2020,5
The Young Man was very professional. Did his job and was gone.I just thought I should have gotten more for the car.,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
"I had a busted up car that didn't run, was not expecting such a good offer. Definitely wasn't expecting the offer to get even better once I submitted the pictures.",21 ao√ªt 2020,5
Quick response and easy to do business with.,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
"They kept their word and did what they said,,,,i will do business with Car Brain again!",21 ao√ªt 2020,4
"Very reliable, no hassel no stress",21 ao√ªt 2020,5
"the service was easy but until you agree to sell your car to them they will not stop sending messages. NONSTOP on your computer ,email,text messages,phone calls and just when you thought tele-marketers and robo calls were bad these guys are worse. But they got the sale and I got my cash.",21 ao√ªt 2020,3
Moderately easy process. Was advised driver would call in route to pick up vehicle but never received call.  Finally @ 1630 I drove to vehicle storage location about 20 min away and found driver just arriving.  Other than scheduling everything was fairly straight forward.  If in the same position again I would likely be a return customer.,21 ao√ªt 2020,4
CarBrain was a very simple service to get some dough for the car that was not running and parked in my driveway.  Not a bad car but not worth repairing--obtaining an online offer (which was better than other online offers) and eventual car pick-up were an amazingly simple procedure.  Would certainly recommend and use again to take out the hassle of selling a less than perfect car.,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
Fast & easy got my Crashed Car bought off me for a fair price grateful.,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
"Easy, and did exactly what they said.",21 ao√ªt 2020,5
It couldn‚Äôt have gone any better. I think the offer was fair and the whole process went very smooth. I would use CarBrain again!,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
car was picked up a day late after I sat for three hours waiting for pick-up,21 ao√ªt 2020,3
"I was trying to figure out what to do with my car, which wasn‚Äôt in the greatest shape. CarBrain was easy to use to get an initial estimate, and they were quick to reach out after to get more information to update the estimate to give the best offer possible. I had a contact person who answered my questions, and the process itself was convenient and the easiest part of moving on to a new car. It was also, from what I could tell from a decent amount of research, a very reasonable offer for my car given its condition and buying it through pictures.",21 ao√ªt 2020,5
"Offered me double what I would have gotten from the junkyard, came and picked it up with a tow truck within a day. Satisfied customer!",21 ao√ªt 2020,5
We were unsure if this was legit but proceeded anyway and it turned out to be an excellent experience. Highly recommend.,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
It was easy and convenient.  Got a great price for a vehicle I thought was worthless.,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
I called CarBrain on a Monday. Sent pictures of the car and title. Accepted the offer. A tow truck operator picked the car up on Thursday and gave me a check. The check cleared on Friday. It was a hassle-free experience. Thank you.,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
"My daughters car broke down and the repairs cost more than the car was worth, we didn't want to sink any more money into an old car. It didn't run so couldn't trade it in or even take it somewhere without paying for it to get towed (again, didn't want to spend any more money on it). After doing some searching online stumbled on Car Brain and decided to post it to see what would happen. By the next day had gotten a fair offer for the old car, and after accepting the offer had an appointment scheduled for the pickup a few days later. They gave us a check and towed it away. It was a really quick and easy process with great communication from them the whole time.",21 ao√ªt 2020,5
"Had some significant engine issues in my pickup and really had no choice but to sell. Found CarBrain and immediately thought, ""There's no way it can be as easy as they say."" Went ahead and submitted the minimal required information and almost immediately received their offer that was higher than I expected. Exchanged a few texts with a friendly rep, and within several days at a mutually agreed-upon time they sent a tow truck. Driver handed me a check and within minutes my truck was gone. I was blown away at how easy and pleasant the entire experience was. Can't recommend CarBrain highly enough!",21 ao√ªt 2020,5
Gave me great offer for my van. The very next day i was paid and van was gone. Very professional and easy to use.,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
"The entire process worked as advertised.  I had a couple of concerns and reservations.  CarBrain worked with me to ensure I was confident in the process and what to expect.  If you agree with their offer, the rest is easy-peasy!",21 ao√ªt 2020,5
Was skeptical at first about selling my vehicle to strangers but the process was very easy and went off with zero issues. Once I sold mine I suggested other to use them as well.,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
Using car brain was excellent. I felt like they gave me a very fair price for my car and we arrange pick up the very next day. Handoff of the car was simple and easy and I had my check in hand within 24 hours. I would definitely recommend using car brain to anyone I knew,21 ao√ªt 2020,4
My experience with your team was excellent! No issues to report. Flawless transaction from start to finish!Thanks!,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
I was skeptical about selling my old used car after searching many places. Eventually I found CarBrain and they made the process easy to get a quote and sell my car. I honestly would recommend them to my friends.,21 ao√ªt 2020,5
"The actual rating is a 4.5, the customer service is excellent, step-by-step walk thru, even when I was indecisive. The only snag was in the pickup of the vehicle. Although there was confusion, the end result was great customer service. I will definitely use CarBrain again, if needed.",20 ao√ªt 2020,5

"It was an easy process! Filled out the information online, received an offer right away. Once I clicked ‚Äúaccept‚Äù I received a phone call to confirm the information about my vehicle. Two days later they came with a check and took the car away. No complaints here.",20 ao√ªt 2020,5
"CarBrain answered all of my questions quickly and had no problem with my many questions as I was learning about the service.Review, photos, price - boom Done!.My only complaint was about the service to pick up the car.  While they were polite and worked with me as I had to work to get the rusted license plates off, they were supposed to give me an hour's notice before they would be there so that I could be available.  No notice, they just showed up.",20 ao√ªt 2020,5
Getting more money for my car would have resulted in CarBrain getting a higher rating.,20 ao√ªt 2020,5
I would not recommend this company. They stated they would arrive at 11 am the next day. Did not show tell 4 pm. Walks up says cadillac converter is not the original and drops price by $50. Now this is after my husband has been home ALL DAY waiting on him. Very unprofessional there are many other companies that will come out and pay what they offer online as well as pay you cash not check. This was very shady and won't go through this company ever again. Beware!,20 ao√ªt 2020,5
"Only complaint is that there wasn't a lot of ""what to expect"" but over all the experience was quick and now I dont' have to stare at that mess of a car anymore. They picked it up from the auto shop and left my check with them, per my instructions. Payment was what was discussed and went through when cashed. I would do it again.",04 ao√ªt 2020,4

"Id never used this service before I used CarBrain. Unfortunately lost my LS430 best car I ever owned due to accident I had. Decided best thing to do was let it go and found CarBrain and they were patient and fair.The process took some time but, wasn‚Äôt difficult at all. They come pick up your car for you and with payment in hand. So convenient, though a difficult time losing my car. I felt better knowing I got a professional company to get the car and maybe it‚Äôll be repaired or those parts that still work will be of use to a person in need of reliable parts from a Lexus LS430.I‚Äôll definitely recommend them and use CarBrain again. Friendly customer service and faster process than I expected.",27 juillet 2020,5
Excellent. Fast and reliable.,27 juillet 2020,5
"I have never considered selling a car online, because I have always traded in.

Carbrain was excellent with there service! I would recommend to others.,27 juillet 2020,5
"Predatory company, especially with COVID-19. Felt like they were praying upon my situation hoping I would be desperate. Go with Peddle, way better experience.So, I entered my VIN and stuff but did not have any pics at the time and was going to put them in the next day. It said based on everything I would be offered $4390-$2500 and would need pics for more value.Before I could submit pics they already sent me an offer for $2250 later that next day. I emailed Angela (very unprofessional, never answers direct questions and replies with generic responses) sent her the pics and everything. My car had nothing but an engine problem; the exterior and interior was pristine. I told her I was expecting to get closer to the 4 range for my Mercedes. She replied and said she would update my file and shop with buyers. A few hours later, CONGRATS you have an offer for $2250. I was like so you are giving me the same exact price as the one with no pictures. She replied with a generic response and said that was all that the buyers could do basically.  I knew what my vehicle was worth and even if you wanted to part the thing out. It made no sense. Either she didn‚Äôt want to update the offer or her manager is praying upon my situation from the email I sent.Anyways I got $1800 more on peddle and they are very thorough with the details you enter before they even give you an instant offer. And you have the option to list it.I never review companies but I really felt the need to because I don‚Äôt want people getting screwed. Would never recommend this company and will always recommend Peddle.Reply to Carbrain:I have not used any negative language other than the fact my experience with you all has been negative. And please quit calling my number and trying to contact me. I have no more business with you all other than the your low ball offer that I respectfully declined/questioned.  You should just accept the negative review and get better at being fair. And I would be happy to post all the conversations I‚Äôve had. But there‚Äôs no need I explained it thoroughly and honestly enough.My advice to others: read what the low reviews say because they are all very similar to my experience because I feel like they pump up their 5-star reviews on this site just like an amazon product.",27 juillet 2020,4
Happy with the service.  The rate CarBrain gave to my junk car was reasonable and the online process was super easy.,27 juillet 2020,1
"Although you did not increase your original offer, the time it took to expedite and complete the sale was smooth and efficient.  Yesterday I shared your company contact with a neighbor Steve Peterson, he is now also using your company to dispose of his 2004 Chev truck.  Hope all goes well with his transaction and your companies effort to create satisfied customers multiplies.Mark",18 juillet 2020,5

Quick. Professional...and the best quote. It was a very simple transaction. I will definitely recommend this to my friends. üëçüèª,17 juillet 2020,5
"It was a very simple process and I was fairly happy with CarBrain's service. The actual pickup was weird though. The driver was supposed to call me when he was on his way so that I could meet him at the mechanic's shop. Instead, he went ahead and just picked up the car on his own and only called me when he was heading out of town because he wanted to get my other key. I had to drive across town to meet him and get my check but no one had communicated the agreed-upon price to him. I had to tell him the amount and he acted really annoyed as he wrote it out. I'd probably use CarBrain again because they do make it an easy process (and offered a fair price), but beware that there can be problems depending on the area towing company that they use.",17 juillet 2020,5
"Had hoped the price was a bit higher, but service was quick and efficient!",16 juillet 2020,5
Easiest car selling process I have ever had.  I would recommend.,16 juillet 2020,5
Super easy. Happy with quote. Very responsive customer service.,16 juillet 2020,5
Based on the price I was payed for the car by carbrain I provide one star. I believe the first offer of $600 would have make more sense and fair!,16 juillet 2020,1

"Carbrain was excellent.  They provided a good price for my car based on the accurate and honest info I gave them without an extremely low-ball price that required haggling.  Other companies didn't do the same.  I was very skeptical despite the good reviews for Carbrain (b/c reviews can be faked, especially the google reviews b/c they don't have a 'fake review flag' algorithm; and ... I've seen companies w/ A+ rating w/ the Better Business Bureau have negative yelp reviews).  So ... I made sure that I not only did the research but protected myself at each step (even with this review, everyone should do the same).  I was expecting something underhanded or dishonest or 'stressful' at each step, including the day the tow truck came to pick up the car but... everything went honestly and smoothly.",16 mai 2020,5

Complete confusion by Carbrain about who was handling our transaction. I called the person who emailed me several times to try to complete the deal. He never called me back.

"The reason I chose 4 stars is because, while the actual car brain staff were excellent, the company they contracted out to pick the car up was very difficult to communicate with and had difficulties finding our location due to severe language barrier and then, on top of that, once the driver found our location, they dented the car while attempting hitch it up to the tow truck & did not seem to care (his reaction when I pointed it out seem to be very nonchalant).

"Overall, it was a great experience. It was different just searching around, and looking online trying to find places that could help us get rid of the car or maybe even a trade. I came across this site and just was thinking and pondering about it. I looked into reviews just to make sure that it wasn‚Äôt a SCAMüò∂. But they actually came through, it took a few days but that was because of rain and a really busy weekendü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Of course!! Lol. Yet to say i was satisfied in the end and i didn‚Äôt have to pay to get it towed away ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§ó. Anyways i have definitely passed the word since then and hope for the best to anybody who wants to get rid of a car that‚Äôs not in need.Thanx Carbrain!!!‚ù§Ô∏è",25 mars 2020,5

"CarBrain was very easy to work with and they gave me the best deal of any company I looked at. I even talked with someone from the same auction who car brain used to pickup my vehicle and he said that they wouldn't give me half what CarBrain did. It seemed a little dicey at first but I'm very glad I used it. I got $1,200 for my car with a blown head gasket and 255,000 miles.",24 mars 2020,3
Seamless pickup from the repair shop. Paid me more than I expected. Quick and easy.,24 mars 2020,5
I believe carbrain gave me the best deal for my car! They also came to my home to pick up the car at no extra expense! Very satisfied with carbrain experience!,24 mars 2020,5
Super easy and QUICK!  Was impressed with professional level of employees.  Would recommend and utilize in the future if the need arises!,24 mars 2020,5
Car Brain was a pleasure to work with. They were very upfront with explaining their procedures and everything played out perfectly. They were very professional and hid nothing!Thank you,24 mars 2020,5
"First I went on their website and then I called them, they asked me to send them a picture of my car, and also title. Made an offer and scheduled the pick up.The pick up guy was very nice, handed me the check, asked me to confirm if I took out everything and done.They gave me the highest rate for my totaled car-  in fact double of what others offered me and were treating me as if I was dirt.I give a sincere top class rating to Car Brain for professionalism, good rates, respectful, understanding and they all are just very nice people; Their website is so easy and you get results right away- so satisfying.",24 mars 2020,5
Copart brought good  check  in promised amount.,24 mars 2020,5

Very helpful. Quick and easy!,24 mars 2020,5
"Fast, friendly, great communication, and offered me more money by far than any of the other companies!!!   Highly recommend!",24 mars 2020,5
I had an F350 with a blown engine....The Carbrain staff was helpful and knowledgeable.  The whole process was easy and they helped me every step of the way.  The best part was getting a good price without having to repair my truck.,24 mars 2020,5
"CarBrain was so easy to use. I entered my vehicle information and received an offer immediately. I wasn‚Äôt sure if what i was going to do and waited 5 days before I accepted the offer. I was skeptical of the whole idea, but everything worked as advertised. The tow truck showed up with a bank check and towed the truck away.I was very pleased by the whole experience",24 mars 2020,5
"My car physically looked in top shape but the engine was shutting on and off. For that, I wanted to get a fair price when I decided to sell. I was extremely wary to use a faceless app but I wanted to sell quickly and took a chance. If you're in the same boat, DON'T HESITATE. After looking up the company up on BBB and reading as much reviews as I could find, I took a chance. Well, CarBrain is legit and I had a seamless experience. I snapped photos of the interior and exterior of my car and sent them over to a sales associate. She came back with a quote that I wasn't quite happy with and they renegotiated with a slightly higher price. After locking in that deal, they gave me instructions to get the title ready for transfer. A tow truck company then contacted me the next day to arrange a pick up time. Two days later, the tow truck driver handed me a check in exchange for my title and keys. I cashed my check that same day. No headaches, no hitches, and I got my money :)",24 mars 2020,5
I waiting all day took day off work no yow truck showed up I called car brain who assured I was on the list for pick up. Its 8:15 p.m no tow truck and I still have my van. Scam?,18 mars 2020,1
"The reviews are correct. This was the easiest sale of a car I've ever made. CarBrain actually INCREASED my offer by nearly 25%, the tow driver showed up when he said he would, I gave him the title, he gave me a check for the amount I was expecting and that was it! Simple! Well done folks, from start to finish this was as easy as it gets. Helpful, honest, I just cant rave enough about my experience!",09 mars 2020,5
"Around 6:30am, I put in an online request to have my sold and taken away for free. By 8:30am I was contacted with information regarding pickup, and by 9:30am I had cash in my hand and my problem car was being taken away. Everyone involved was friendly and professional, and the service was quick and easy to use. I highly recommend this service to anyone who needs a junk car gone ASAP",16 f√©vrier 2020,5
Very reliable and quick transaction. They gave a good price for my car. Will definitely recommend them.,06 f√©vrier 2020,5
The whole process for start to finish was smooth and relatively short. I found everyone to be helpful and thorough in their explanations.,01 f√©vrier 2020,5
"Great !!!  Polite and very easy to make a deal. Fast service, pick up where ever you want with check in hand.  Used for two cars.",28 janvier 2020,5
"My experience with CarBrain was impressive. The process was simple, they gave me a fair price and it was completely honest! No bait and switch.   Those qualities stood out and were the most important to me and I only have positive things to say about CarBrain",23 janvier 2020,5
Easy to deal with the transaction went smooth the tow truck driver came on time and the price we got for the truck was fair. thanks again carBrain,21 janvier 2020,5
CarBrain was beyond my expectations. I never would have believed how much I was given for my car or the professional way they handled the whole transaction. I would highly recommend them!,21 janvier 2020,5
Simple and quick. Reasonable price.,21 janvier 2020,5
"CarBrain made what was a traumatizing experience, easier to deal with. I got in my first accident with a deer and totaled my vehicle. I was skeptical about using this service, but they made it quick and easy. I sent over title, received a call the next day, and someone was out to pick up my vehicle with a check. So simple. Thank you CarBrain!",20 janvier 2020,5
Fast and easy reply. thumbs up for sure,20 janvier 2020,4
Great service!!! Wonderful experience!! Nice guys!,20 janvier 2020,5
Quick and easy and they gave me the highest quote for my 2003 Honda CR-V,19 janvier 2020,5
Very easy process and fast responses.  Not a lot of visibility into listing car on the open network - unclear how viable that was.  But selling direct ended up easy.,18 janvier 2020,4
This is by far the fastest and most professional experience I've had with Car Brain. From the initial contact to the tow truck these are so good people. I highly recommend them. If I had known this company years ago they've gotten all of my business. Keep up the great service Car Brain! Trina out of NC,18 janvier 2020,5
After my accident I was left with a totaled car to get rid of.  I came across Carbrain as I was searching for someone willing to buy a car in this condition.  I am glad I gave them a call to check this out.  I received more from them than I was otherwise offered and they made the process easy and efficient.  I turned over the car and title and Carbrain immediately gave me a check in payment.  I would recommend them to anyone in this situation.,15 janvier 2020,5
Great service they do what they promise on time,15 janvier 2020,5
Ease of service and available to answer questions throughout the process. I was really nervous about sending a picture of my copy of the title but they accepted a picture with sticky notes all over demonstrating that I knew how to fill it out. Pick up was easy and driver was friendly. Great value for a car I expected only to get $30 for!,15 janvier 2020,5
Quick and easy. Very friendly and helpful with questions.,15 janvier 2020,5
At first I was skeptical and unsure if I should use a company I found on-line; with all theses scams that go on. I took my chances anyway. I spoke with a customer service representative on a Wednesday by Friday my car was picked up. I received a check for the exact offer with no hassle. Everything went smooth. I highly recommend this company.,15 janvier 2020,5
The entire process was quicker than what I expected. Of course I wish I could have been paid more for the car but it was comparable to other offers and those other offers would not have taken care of the state documentation. I also realize that the car needed a new engine and that CarBrain has to also make a profit to stay in business. The only downside of my experience was the inflexibility of the towing company. The driver was very accommodating but his company wasn‚Äôt so.,15 janvier 2020,5
"I had a horrible experience trying to get some help from Kia regarding car problems we had while on vacation 1200 miles away from where I live.  We had it have it towed to the nearest Kia dealership.Tried to resolve it for almost 5 months.  Finally gave up and decided to sell the car, but with it being so far away, we didn't know how and honestly didn't have the resolve.  Called CarBrain and they basically took care of everything.  It was such a relief!!  Thank you CarBrain.",15 janvier 2020,5

"The initial sale was easy and hassle-free. The pick-up times were a little limited and then the set, actual time proved to be somewhat unreliable. However, I did appreciate them coming out and picking it up. Plus, they were then respectful of my time. Overall, great customer service by all the reps I dealt with.",14 janvier 2020,5

"I originally just wanted to know how much my car was worth if I sold it for scrap. Answered a few questions online and was sent a fair price so I accepted. They sent a tow truck to my house the next day to pick up my car and paid me as promised.(No extra charge for towing). I kept thinking, "" this is way to easy -whats the catch?"" I had no problems what so ever!",14 janvier 2020,5
Thank you for the polite and professional experience in car purchase.,14 janvier 2020,5
"The effort it took to be sure I crossed all the t‚Äôs and dotted all the i‚Äôs required was nothing compared to finding someone I felt trustworthy. I have suggested others use CarBrain and wish I had another opportunity as well.  Thank -you, I appreciate your help.",14 janvier 2020,1

We got the best quote from Car Brain and they made it easy for us.,13 janvier 2020,5
I received excellent service and was very pleased with the results.,13 janvier 2020,5
I thought the offers they provided for my vehicle were very fair and their process was streamlined and thorough. They answered all my questions and worked through my particular situations. Only hiccup was with the third party towing company as they didn't show as scheduled and once they did the operator was unprofessional. I did let CarBrain know and they were very apologetic about the experience I had with the tow company. I would highly recommend CarBrain to my family and friends.,13 janvier 2020,5
This was the easiest most efficient way to sell our old car. From the representatives on the phone to the actual pick up of the car! I would absolutely recommend Car Brain with total confidence. It was so easy and effortless that I almost thought it couldn‚Äôt be true. But it was!!!,13 janvier 2020,5
"Everything, from start to finish, was very easy. The check cashed right away and I had my undrivable car off my hands in no time. I would definitely recommend them to everyone.",13 janvier 2020,5
This is my second time using carbrain.  It is super easy and convenient.  I recieved an offer almost immediately upon submitting my vehicle information.,13 janvier 2020,5
"State logistics of selling a car is about the only downside to this experience. If you have never sold a car before, it is important to know about the paper work that the state requires when selling a car. I suppose the information on the back of the pink slip explains all that is necessary. That is my only complaint, otherwise everything went fairly smoothly.",13 janvier 2020,4
"I was happy to be able to sell my junk car. However, there was a lot of delay during the pick up process because of the tow truck company.",13 janvier 2020,3
I was surprised how easy it was to sell my car through CarBrain.  My vehicle was non-operation and I was happy to be able to get anything for it!,13 janvier 2020,5
very quick responses and trustworthy to deal with and best offer in the market,13 janvier 2020,5
Very good customer service; just some of the instructions from the beginning was a little confusing when it came to what was needed to complete the deal and to who should get the car title. I was instructed at first that the car title needed to be sent directly from the Credit Union. After receiving the car title from the towing company that had the vehicle; I was instructed by another person that the title needed to be with the vehicle when they picked it up. I had to pay another FedEx fee to send the title back to where the vehicle was located. At the end everything was finally completed; it just took additional time that could have been avoided. We did receive the check in a very shortly after the vehicle was picked up.Opinion from Senior Collections Officer (Brenda Jackson) who worked with CarBrain Agency(s).,13 janvier 2020,5
"Got an online quote for peanuts. I never agreed to anything, I never accepted the offer and yet I can not get them to stop calling and emailing l me about picking up my truck. They even set up an auction company to try to come pick up my truck. I had to inform this auction company that i never agreed to anything with CARBRAIN and that they should cancel any and all information they may have under my name.CARBRAIN has been harassing me for almost 5 days now with phone calls and emails and will not listen to my pleas to stop contacting me and telling them I am not interested in their services.",13 janvier 2020,4

"Easy transaction, they didn‚Äôt waste my time rescheduling my pick up appointment. I recommend to others",04 janvier 2020,5
"I am really surprised by the good reviews I am seeing, my experience was just awful. After I accepted my offer I was sent an email that specifically stated the tow company would be contacting me. When this never happened i called carbrain and they told me that the company would not call me, I had to call them. I explained to them that it specifically states on their email that the tow company will contact you, why include that if its not true? Fast forward to two failed attempts at getting the car towed and multiple messages left on various answering machines of various tow companies and this whole experience was a giant flop. Add to that the fact that I had to ask 3 elderly people to have their cars moved because i was waiting for a tow truck that never came. I was finally told the tow company rescheduled without telling me after wasting an ENTIRE day. After weeks of this, I cancelled my lowball offer from carbrain and went ahead with donating my car. Thanks for absolutely nothing but wasted time and inconvenience. I don‚Äôt even normally write reviews.",04 janvier 2020,5
"Canceled my order. I am selling to someone else. Their agent had us driving all over town getting things notarized so it could be sold today. All this time I could have been working with someone else. My wife was late to work. I had to cancel other engagements. It was all to work with this guy to get it done. Then, as we were going to finalize, he just dropped off the face of the Earth and apparently went home for the day. I called his ""cell"" line and then the main line 3 times before they closed while waiting for his response. I talked to reps that just said someone would call me. I tried to get a hold of him or anyone that would call me back. No one did even after three attempts over 2 hours before closing. Not acceptable business practice.",04 janvier 2020,5
This company has stepped up to honor their commitment. I would recommend them.,04 janvier 2020,1
the team was very helpful in the process.  thanks,03 janvier 2020,1
Everything was great up until working with the tow truck driver. He ended up being two hours late due to a truck problem.  Did not call to let me know. When he did show up could not tow the car because of the three flat tires on the car. I informed carbrain there were three flat tires but he was unaware. Gave me the check and we went out separate ways.,12 d√©cembre 2019,5
It was fast and easy! From getting a quote to having it get picked up the next couple of days! The quote was also a great price for the condition of my car. I would recommend to anyone who is trying to get rid of an old or broken down car!,07 d√©cembre 2019,5
"From the time I discovered Car Brain, entered the simple information about my 30 year old vehicle, received an offer and accepted it, to, transfer and payment (by check) at the arranged time of pick-up, involved only three days.....  No hassle, no hustle, done. And, I chose to deal with the online DMV Release of Liability myself....quick and easy..",05 d√©cembre 2019,3
"Got a decent offer - much better than local offers.  Professional, timely communication.  Pickup was done as scheduled.  CarBrain associate followed up with me while I was still considering other options, but he wasn't pressuring for quick decision.  Definitely recommend.",03 d√©cembre 2019,5
It was a quick and easy process no crazy paper work involved. Just sent some pictures of my Jeep and what was wrong with it and from there they gave me a quote. Then from there you accept the offer when they give it to you and then from there the tow truck company for your area comes and you hand over the title and the check is yours. I liked it because the tow was free so that was a big positive for me since it wasn‚Äôt running properly . Also to communicate you can simply text or email at your convenience,01 d√©cembre 2019,5
Very easy process. Was very surprised. Excellent service,30 novembre 2019,5

"I had a great experience with CarBrain. I was told by my dealer service that my car had a key component fail in the engine and cost quoted was more or less the value of the car. The dealer told me they would not take the car. CarBrain offered me a fair price and heir customer service was excellent. I worked with Angela and she was polite, responsive and extremely helpful. She helped me coordinate through some paperwork issues and took care of towing the vehicle etc. They helped me a lot and I would honestly recommend their business if you have a car that‚Äôs not mechanically ideal.",27 novembre 2019,5
"To be honest I, like many others was very skeptical about this. I have a 2009 VW Tiguan, the engine had died and it was sitting in a repair shop in Orlando while I was in Jacksonville. I asked the repair shop if they could it sell it they said I‚Äôd maybe get $200 dollars. Which was nothing because the car was in excellent condition it just unfortunately no longer had a working engine. I took the risk and got a quote from carbrain and they offered me $750. Which was way higher than the repair shops offer. I went ahead and went through with it, took photos of my car. Took photos of the vin, and went ahead with the process. I asked a lot of questions and was communicated with via text and it was so smooth. The process itself took maybe a week if not less. I didn‚Äôt even have to be in Orlando for them to pick it up. They sent me a prepaid label for my title and I sent in the title, they let me know they received it and sent out my check. I deposited it and it went through and it‚Äôs been about a month now and I‚Äôm still so pleased with the easy service. I would do this again if needed. A lot of people complain about waiting for the tow truck for a while, if you can‚Äôt be there then just send your title in the mail. It was so easy and I didn‚Äôt have to take work off to sit somewhere and wait for my car to be picked up.",27 novembre 2019,5

"Overall process was organic and real. You have nothing to worry ab as far as being scammed. It is a process and you do need to know the process can change the amount of money you receive.  I had had a problem with my title and the value of my car changed in a 3 week time frame of trying to get a new title. It ended up being a difference of 100.00 dollars. It originally was more, I did haggle with them over my scenario and they did come back up but not all the way.

I waited several days due to other life stuff happening and received a slightly better offer. My car engine was no longer running and I had a replacement already so I was grateful to receive an offer AND have it be towed right from my house. I mainly just wanted an easy solution to get rid of my car and make some extra money. Carbrain offered me several time windows and days.

He handed me a check in exchange for the title and the check cleared no problem.",20 novembre 2019,5

"My 2012 Mercedes GL350 Bluetec died on the highway in Tennessee. (Start of a good country song perhaps?). Anyway, the cost to rebuild the engine with 130K miles did not make financial sense. Carbrain offered me a very fair price for my otherwise unusable vehicle. They did everything they said they would -- from paperwork to vehicle pickup. The team over there was responsive, friendly and helpful at each step. I usually don't waste time posting online reviews but I really felt what Carbrain did was super all the way. Thanks.",20 novembre 2019,5
"For the most part, I had a good experience. Most of the time, my questions were answered immediately and I was helped with any concerns. There were a few times my inquiries slipped through the cracks and I had to follow through to get answers. Also, I was told to go to the bank and ask for a document releasing the lien, but it turned out laws are different in California about titles, so the info I requested wasn't the correct info. Also, I had to be proactive about calling the bank because my representative couldn't reach them supposedly after several tries even though I was able to reach them the 1st time each time I called. So I had to do some extra step that I probably shouldn't have been required to do.",20 novembre 2019,5

"Great Service and Communication..  Posted an old 2007 Toyota Matrix that was drivable but had over $4000 worth of collision damage.  I went on the website, posted some pictures and received a decent sale price.  CarBrain was in constant communication with me the entire process.  They arranged for the caro to be picked up free of charge, and the driver handed me the check upon pickup.  The only issue was that the driver showed up two hours after the estimated window time of between 1 and 5 oclock with no phone call to say he was delayed.  But overall, a very good experience.",20 novembre 2019,5
"Was very skeptical at first doing everything online, taking pictures of both my VIN and my title left me worried.

I had a nice Mercedes that needed over $7000 in engine work. I was unable to drive it. Car brain gave me a fair deal without the hassle of posting it on craigslist. Really smooth transaction. Tow company came in about 10 minutes of scheduled four hour pick up window. I was floored. Everyone was professional. Not once did I feel I was getting scammed. I'm sure they are parting my care for $$ but I'm not going to do that so it is a win-win for everyone.,20 novembre 2019,5
"My experience with CarBrain was hassle free and I'm happy I came across their website. Johan was my contact at Carbrain, he was always available via text and took care of all of my questions and concerns. They dealt with the title transfer and organized a towing truck company to come and pick up my damaged vehicle at no cost. I know they work with different towing companies but Lucky Transport was the designated towing company in my case and they were so prompt. I forgot the name of the guy who towed my car but he was very friendly and made a concerted effort to not damage my driveway given that (2) tires were missing. I really appreciated how quick and easy this was.",20 novembre 2019,5

"It was SO quick and easy I almost thought it was a scam! I was so impressed because I enjoy getting things done easily on my phone, but I never thought I‚Äôd be able to get a quote, sell and sign within minutes. A burden that I thought was going to take countless phone calls several weeks and lots of frustration, they did it in minutes. Plus they offered way more then the junk yards.",24 octobre 2019,5
Great experience.  Fast and easy.,24 octobre 2019,5
"My vehicle broke down and had to be towed to a car repair shop over an hour away from my home. The cost to repair the vehicle was more than the vehicule was worth and to get it towed home would also be probability expensive I looked into several options for selling my vehicle for parts.I was very hesitant selling my non running vehicle via the internet through CarBrain. Once I enter the vehicle information and provided photos they provide me a price for buying my vehicle in a very timely manner.Once we agreed on the price CarBrain arraigned for my vehicle to be picked up and provided me a check at the time of pick up as advertised.Because my vehicle was at a car repair shop over an hour away coordination for the pick up was necessary with the designated towing company. However the Towing company was very unorganized and did not show up when scheduled. They did however get a tow truck to pick up the vehicle several hours late after I called when they did not show up. The tow company driver was very professional and diligent in reviewing the paperwork before accepting delivery of my vehicle and provided me with the agreed up on price once the vehicle was accepted.This process was so much easer, faster and hassle free than selling via Craig's list or Facebook I would have no issues using CarBrain in the future for selling a non running vehicle.",24 octobre 2019,5

"When I had to sell my 2014 Kia Sorento with a blown engine, I searched online and found the CarBrain site, and was I ever glad I did. I emailed them on a Sunday night. They responded on Monday and asked me to send some info on the vehicle, as well as a few photos. They said they would check with their partners in my area and make an offer. By Wednesday  I had an offer which was for much more than I thought I'd get.  I accepted and they sent me the contact info. I set up the pickup for Thursday and the tow driver arrived on time with a check for the agreed upon amount. I signed over the title and deposited the check on Friday. Fast, easy and done in 5 days all online. Amazing.Thank you Carbrain. I'll be sure to tell all my friends about your company.",21 octobre 2019,5
At first I was skeptical about the whole transaction since all negotiations was through email but they kept their word all the way to the end.. I texted all info and received the check after signing over the title with the car pick up. They really give you a decent amount for your auto. I have already recommended someone  !! Thank you üòä,19 octobre 2019,1
"Everything went well in the beginning.  I was given an offer within 24 hours.  I spoke with my representative and was assured that he was here to make the sale as easy as possible for me.  In the end however, I was left alone to deal with the third party that was picking up my car.  When several complications arose, the CarBrain representative did not answer my emails or return my phone calls.  The process ended up taking me several weeks and two 4 hour round trips to get finished up. I definitely regret not selling it locally!",18 octobre 2019,5
"The app was very easy to use. My transaction went very smoothly and as described.The only surprises were not being able to get the consultant assigned to me on the phone (vs. email) and when I chose to put it out on the Carbrain network for a higher price, I was not expecting to be bombarded by text messages.The pick up was on time and as described.",17 octobre 2019,5
"It was very easy and they give you a quote immediately. I had lost my title, so they put my account on hold so I could send for a new one.

"Carbrain should pay with cashiers checks as standard business practice, not company checks. They charge a fee for a cashiers check and it delays the process.ANY buyer who is taking possession of a vehicle and signed title should provide cleared funds. Telling the seller to ""Trust us. We're good for it,"" is not clean business. It IS a big deal in an industry where there is a great deal of fraud.Otherwise, pretty smooth process.",11 octobre 2019,3
This company was so easy and wonderful to work with. Highly recommend!,11 octobre 2019,5
Fast & professional. Thank you for an easy transaction and excellent customer service.,10 octobre 2019,5
"Mixed experience. Positive: they bought my ruined car (bad engine) quickly. Negatives: (1) they dropped the price at the very end after I had already accepted their ""offer"" without any explanation (by 22%); (2) their contractor (Copart) had many, many issues: (2.a) they mistakenly sent a tow-truck without contacting me, thinking it was an insurance pickup and the driver had to drive back 1 hour; (2.b) they finally arranged a second pickup, but the check I was given had sloppy writing and would not be accepted by my bank or the issuing bank; (2.c) the entire process took nearly a month from when I accepted their initial ""offer"" to when I was able to cash a proper check into my account. Stressful and infuriating process, but they bought the car and took it off my hands. So, mixed experience.",10 octobre 2019,3

"The rep I worked with, Angela, was friendly and helpful for the most part. However, she had a hard time answering a couple of questions about the transfer-of-ownership process, so it was frustrating to have to do my own digging to find the answers to my questions. Another rep eventually confirmed my answers, but it took five emails and a phone call (with a 10-minute wait on hold). Ultimately, the experience wasn't trouble-free, but I was satisfied that I got a pretty good (not great) price for my vehicle, the pickup and payment happened according to schedule, and the check cleared‚Äîwhich was my main concern. I would recommend Carbrain, with a few caveats.",07 octobre 2019,3

Please don't use this company. The towing company they set me up with kept me waiting for eight hours!!! I had to drive 2 hours to meet them where my car was stuck and then waited for eight hours before the guy contacted me and told me he was 2 hours away and wanted to re-scedule for the next day. I wasted 12 hours of my life. The women who were the contact for the tow company were USELESS. Call Peddle if you have a car to sell. They were excellant!!,26 ao√ªt 2019,5
"Went thru Carbrain.  However, the towing company they used was very unreliable.{McHugh's) My car was at my mechanic's so I had to meet the towing company there. Had an appt at 2:30, they didn't show. Then at 4:00pm, they still didn't show. Around 5:00pm they finally said they had to reschedule. So I donated my car to Kars4KidsI wasted my whole afternoon and my mechanic still has my car sitting in front of his place.  He is kind enough to let me keep it there.",26 ao√ªt 2019,5

I couldn't find the title after I received their offer, but when I found it a month later, they still honored their offer.  I talked to a representative on the phone and she set up the sale.  They gave me a time frame on a day that was convenient for me and came during that time.  The driver was professional and friendly.  He even mentioned that the other car he was carrying had been sold to another company for much less and it was a nicer car!",13 ao√ªt 2019,5
I was very satisfied with my experience with CarBrain. I received more money than I first thought I would. They lay all the options out and you decide. Simple to use. The only area of opportunity was the directions for preparing the title to be transferred. Had to make an extra trip to the notary. Overall I would definitely recommend CarBrain.,13 ao√ªt 2019,5

I‚Äôm very satisfied with my dealings with Carbrain. I got a more than fair price for my 2007 Toyota Tacoma considering the damage from having an accident.

"My cars' engine died 6 hours away from home while my son was visiting friends.  We decided it was too expensive to repair and only had a few days to find a way to dispose of it and get some money back.  Trying to do this remotely is not easy.  We found CarBrain on the internet, completed the online information and received a quote.  After a few phone calls to CarBrain and other businesses we decided to go with CarBrain.  They were offering the most and many of the other places required you to be present or have the car towed to their facility for an appraisal.  They arranged for the car to be towed to auction, sent a Fedex label for us to send the title and a few days later we had a check.  It all went as explained to us and we were able to call and text our contact at CarBrain whenever we had questions.  I would recommend if you are ever in this situation.",12 ao√ªt 2019,4

I was told that ""while one partner made an offer in your area,Your car doesnt meet our needs"" Doesn't meet your needs??? You buy non working cars!!! Is mine not broken enough??

I was extremely skeptical of using an online service to sell my car. I talked with multiple individuals in the company and read extensive reviews and finally gave it a shot. Be aware you are most likely going to be dealing with a 3rd party company as well. I had no issue cashing the check from their provided towing company Copart and would recommend this service.,02 juillet 2019,5
A lot of miscommunication because the call center was not relaying messages so it was more frustrating than I expected,01 juillet 2019,5

I was given a check on the spot; I gave them the keys and title; and that was all there was to it. It couldn't have been simpler and more convenient. Also, their customer service was top-notch, and everyone I talked with was very nice and professional. They deserve every five star that I gave them.",30 juin 2019,5
At first I was skeptical about using an online service.  The professionalism and quickness of this company was excellent!  My contact (Johan) was very knowledgeable and helped to make sure everything was in order.  They offered more $$ than local dealers and pickup was scheduled for the next day.  Very simple and easy to use!,28 juin 2019,5

Terrible communication but best price.",24 juin 2019,4

"CarBrain offered me the best cash offer I could find for my truck. They even included a free tow, and the transaction was exactly as advertised.

Was a simple straightforward process and was given a more than fair offer on my totaled Charger.,24 juin 2019,5
"I have never had an experience like this ever before. CarBrain and its partner in Los Angeles AA Import promised to purchase my care for $350. They promised the purchase would be completed within two days. I agreed to offer on 5/31 and they didn't schedule pick-up until 6/4. 15 minutes before we were supposed to meet, AA Import sent me a text and said they weren't paying the $350 we had been discussing for several days and they only were going to pay $250. CarBrain said they couldn't do that, etc, etc. I waited for hours to hear back as to when they would pick up my car and they never did. So after almost a week of stringing me along the only thing that CarBrain did for me was rack up a storage bill of $400. I talked with the COO about all of these issues and his response was ""thank you for taking the time to detail things out, I am sure the company will learn a lot from your experience.""",24 juin 2019,5
"I was a little hesitant initially but once I did my research u felt more at ease.  Milton was very helpful throughout our the process.

Had the unfortunate experience of my Honda Fit's engine going bad at only 125K miles.  The garage who diagnosed it offered me $500...Honda dealer offered me $300 for a trade in.  Carbrain offered me a good deal more.  Seemed a little disorganized but AAA tow truck showed up and gave me a check and took the car and title.  Transaction was speedy and no hassle.  Definitely made the most of a bad situation.,08 juin 2019,5

Very nice and easy to do business with this company.,07 juin 2019,5
My experience was hassle free and very pleasant.,07 juin 2019,5
"CarBrain is quick and painless for getting initial offers directly from them, but suffers from a disconnect between their website and associate buyers. I would‚Äôve liked to take the time to list my car for sale on their website and see what offers I got from other people, but I was in a time crunch due to vehicle location and didn‚Äôt have that luxury. Associate buyer was very quick to respond up until I told them that I accepted the offer from CarBrain directly. After that, I had to call their main customer service line every time I needed clarification  because I no longer received any responses from the buyer that had been assigned to me. Tow truck arrived in window to take the car away, but I wish they had called to tell me an approximate time on the day of since I didn‚Äôt live at the pickup location. I was there for the full 4 hour window, but they didn‚Äôt call me until they were a half hour out (3 hours into said window).Good service for someone who needs a car off their hands quickly and doesn‚Äôt care much what they get for it; it was gone within 48 hours of my acceptance of the offer.",06 juin 2019,3

"Usually, I'm skeptical of services like this and this time was no different.  But I got a more than fair offer, which was upheld and the entire process was very easy.

I highly recommend CarBrain.",02 juin 2019,5

Easy to work with via email. Upfront quote and stayed true to original amount offered. Arrangements for pick up were easy. I found them to be very professional and would certainly call again if the same need were to arise. Would definitely recommend to anyone needing to pass along an imperfect car they no longer drive and do not plan to trade in.,01 juin 2019,5

Easiest transaction I could imagine. Took a bit for the tow to arrive to our town. I didn‚Äôt mind waiting the weekend and a day or two. They‚Äôve got the convenience down via text message or e-mail. I just send them photos of the vehicle and some relevant info and boom an offer came - done.Would recommend to my family.,01 juin 2019,5
Awsome experience,01 juin 2019,5
you did good lob,01 juin 2019,5
"Amazing. Original estimated offer was 1650 on a 2008 rav4 with a blown transmission. I called the next day and sent pictures of the vehicle. Within a couple hours they got back to me with an official offer of 1620, and we scheduled the pickup for the next morning. The guy showed up during the time frame they gave me and gave me a call an hour ahead of time. He had the check with him. I was very skeptical about carbrain, but they helped me big time. I got an appraisal on my car for 1200 at a carmax, and because of car brain I was able to put a bigger down payment down on a new car. Thanks!!",01 juin 2019,5
"This whole process worked amazingly well!  I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.  They came and picked up my vehicle with absolutely no hassle, they gave me the check just like they said they would with no haggle.  They also gave me more money than the local boneyard was going to give me.  This is a total no brainer, easy, simple, clean!  I was a little skeptical at 1st, but now I would recommend this to my friends and family.",31 mai 2019,5
"Very professional.Had a problem that check did not have 2 signatures, but they remedied it immediately.Very happy with the service.",31 mai 2019,5
"I did not like the fact that I never received emails that I was told I would be receiving. Everything was done through text. That would have been an issue if the number I provided had been a landline. I scheduled the vehicle pick up at one time, but was contacted and told it would be another. I also wish I would have been able to receive a single check. Other than that the best offer that I received.",31 mai 2019,4
I was really impressed  how  friendly  and professional  and  on time they were.I would do business  with  them  again and tell everyone  how good  they were.,31 mai 2019,5

"I emailed car brain about my car that needed to be salvaged. They quoted back to me a price, a few days later a tow truck picked up my car and handed over a check for said amount. No haggling and hassle free.",31 mai 2019,5
The quote for my car was good and got the towing company to schedule pick up next day. My only issue to not give a 5 star is that I feel like the tow truck driver was trying to RIP me off with the amount that I was supposed to get didnt match what he was trying to give me. I called car brain to confirm the qty and they fixed it.,31 mai 2019,5
Very easy transaction.,31 mai 2019,4

They forgot to leave us a check so we had to mail title in,31 mai 2019,4
"As many others have said, Carbrain appears too good to be true. However, my experience was entirely positive and exactly as described. The employees were quick to respond and answer and questions I had throughout the process. My car also had broken down 4 hours away from where I live, and they were flexible in working with me even though I did not have immediate access to my vehicle. I would use this service again.",31 mai 2019,5
"They were ok, but just got the salvage price as middlemen, then the buyer didn‚Äôt show when they said they would (copay). Not really their fault, but nothing special.",31 mai 2019,3

"I don't think so.  You guys are worse in a pawn shop. And all these 5 star ratings ,how much did you pay them for that?

Don't know how you stay in business?  gotta be somebody severely hard up for money",30 mai 2019,1

Fast. Competitive offer.Within $100 of other companies that do this.,16 mai 2019,5
"Customer representative Mary R. was very respectful and helpful in the selling process.  I do however feel that there were extenuating circumstances (5 brand new parts within last 3 months added to vehicle which totaled $750 in parts alone) which I feel should've yielded more consideration to a higher selling price.  I do feel that I was cornered in to the lowest payout price due to lack of other viable options. Left me with a bittersweet experience but payout turnaround time is exceptional and extremely easy.Also their third party The tow truck driver was very informative, helpful and pleasant during pickup of vehicle and delivery of payment.",16 mai 2019,3
This process was fast and efficient. My points of contact responded in a timely manner.All went well. Thanks!,16 mai 2019,5

Within an hour, I received a phone call and once I talked with them for a bit, I was very impressed with how they do business.

"I was in a stressful situation - not knowing what to do with my old car - the registration had expired, and I was told it wouldn't pass the smog test without investing another 2K - the car likely would not have lasted another year+..so i needed to get rid of it. Most dealerships only accept used cars with valid registration-  I felt stuck, but luckily ran across CarBrain. Everything was so simple and easy. Yeah, maybe I could've gotten a few hundred dollars more by selling it elsewhere, but CarBrain took care of everything - all the paperwork, the towing, etc. I got the check right on the spot.I'm very happy with how things were taken cared of.",14 mai 2019,5

"This was a wonderful company to deal with. They were very easy  to deal with online and on the phone. The price they gave me was the best I had gotten and they sent it in a timely manner.The car was picked up and payment rendered in just a few days.Thank you,Carbrain!!",11 mai 2019,4
I am writing this review to make people aware that when you receive the check from the local agent (copart) that picks up your car and title you will not be able to cash it right away as you will be mislead into believing. You will have to hold the check at least 24 business hours to cash it. I went to the bank that the check was written on and there system told them to return the check to copart. After speaking to the manager I was able to keep the check because she had witness this before. When I called copart the lady I spoke to seemed to be bothered by my call. I have still not been able to cash the check but on Monday I will try again. PLEASE KNOW THAT WHEN IT SAYS YOU WILL GET YOUR CHECK THE SAME DAY THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CASH THAT DAY AND IF ITS A FRIDAY YOU MAY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL MONDAY.,10 mai 2019,5
"My first thought is that if it seems too good to be true then it usually is...  Not the case here, this place is legit!  It was easy and seamless, and I feel they gave us a fair price for our vehicle.  I would recommend CarBrain to my family and friends.",10 mai 2019,5
I had some hesitation but the car towing and payment method all went off without a hitch. Excellent customer service from Bill and Carolyn!,10 mai 2019,2
My engine seized on my 6 year old BMW and the dealership offered no help to cover the costs since it was out of warranty and no salvage price. Since repairs were worth more than the car I turned to CarBrain. They quickly set me up with a buyer in the area and towed my car at no charge. They offered thousands for my car compared to the hundreds the dealership offered.,10 mai 2019,5
Very professional and nice. They‚Äôll help and answer any questions that you have!,10 mai 2019,5
Car Brain is an easy and beneficial process from start to finish. I was in a tough spot and Car Brain gave me an offer on my truck and saved me from financial trouble!

Quick and simple process. Great customer assistanceüëçüëç,09 mai 2019,5
"I cannot stress enough how great CarBrain is. The process was almost too easy that I had to question if it was a scam. I decided to trust them and proceed with the sale. I might have been able to get more money from posting on craigslist or another personal seller venue, however I did not want to go through the hassle of going through emails, bartering, towing fees, title transfers etc. CarBrain seemed too good to be true. I even had last minute questions and was able to text with a REAL person at 6am in the morning. Once I accepted their offer they were here in 2 days to pick up my truck. I showed the driver my notorized title and keys and he handed me a check on the spot. The guy was super respectful of my lawn and was very professional.I would recommend CarBrain to anyone who is looking for a no hassle, quick sale of their vehicle.",09 mai 2019,5

"I was a little hesitant at first, thinking the process to sell my vehicle that needed an engine replaced was too easy to sell using carbrain.  I ended up calling the customer service number to ask questions in more detail before having the confidence with completing the process.  I am so glad I did!  I ended up selling my car for 2700 and the dealer was only willing to give 1000 trade in.  Calling in to ask more questions only made the process harder than it should‚Äôve been.  Carbrain had a tow truck meet me the next day with a check in hand for my vehicle.  It was sad to see the car go, knowing I would have to buy something new, but glad I had an extra 1700 to put towards my next purchase.  Thank you Carbrain!",09 mai 2019,5

"With Carbrain the days of the ‚Äúauto junkyard‚Äù and its related peculiarities are gone. Carbrain has created a simple and elegant solution to selling a car. Their website was quick and easy. Picking up the auto was even easier. Tow truck driver set up the appointment, said he would be there at 3:50pm and drove up exactly at that time. Gave him the title, he gave me a check and I was done with the car. What a great concept. I would highly recommend Carbrain to anyone.",09 mai 2019,5
Communication with CarBrain was exceptional!  Any questions were answered immediately and the whole process was very easy from start to finish.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the towing company CarBrain contracted with showed up a day later than they were expected.,09 mai 2019,4

"Carbrain only offered 170.00 for my car. I have already been offered 2500.00 from a previous person, this makes it look like they are trying to buy cars at unfair low prices. I did not sell my car to them, I won't be contacting them ever again.",09 mai 2019,1

Would have been more stars but I had been contacted the day prior and was told I would be given a phone call one hour prior to pick up at the dealership. I literally left the dealership and drove half an hour to another dealership to purchase a car and was called and told that the tow truck driver was there to pick up my Mercedes. Causing me to have to drive all the way back to the other dealership and then back again to purchase my vehicle. So an hour and a half later I was finally set and was able to attend to my needed purchase.,06 mai 2019,3

"This was fairly simple and straightforward, easy.

"I have already recommended your company to several people!  My husband and I didn't know anything about CarBrain but found your website when we were disappointed in the amount a dealer was willing to give us for our vehicle and began searching online for other options.  Honestly, we were a little nervous at first, but your staff was incredibly friendly and so quick to answer all our questions.  We did our homework and everything unfolded just as your website outlined.  The tow company you chose for us actually asked to come a day ahead of time, which worked out for us very well.  The whole process was quick and simple.   Thank you for your excellent service!",30 avril 2019,5

"It was very easy to get a quote. The offer was reduced because I had to wait 2 weeks. They promised pick up from 8am - 12pm.

"It is not my custom to give 5 stars or an excellent rating on the first encounter with a company, it takes more than once to earn it. I didn't get the quickest response I was looking for or an offer that would have raving over CarBrain, however, when all was said and done I can say that even though I had to endure dealing parting with my car (sentimental) the overall experience worked out without much grief.As long as I followed their steps things took place as they proposed.Maybe your offer to win something my ease my pain.",30 avril 2019,4

Very easy process. You simply enter the information just like you do on KBB and you get an estimated price for your car.

They use shady third party contractors. The dude was over an hour late and then decided not to buy the car. Thought this was a guaranteed offer? What a crock of crap. They knew the exact condition of the car and left without it anyways. Thanks for the huge waste of time carbrain. Your guarantee is total b/s. Edit: Car was accurately described. Your site and contractors are just garbage. Where‚Äôs my guaranteed money? Liars.,29 avril 2019,5

"All of my contacts with car brain were awesome but unfortunately Carport who picked up my car sucked. Big time sucked.They never called to let me know they were coming, when I called to follow up since I had to have somebody meet them, and the window in which they were supposed to arrive was rapidly closing.... Her attitude was extremely laid back and she said yeah they're the gonna be there yeah they'll call.  Well they didn't call, and they took the car before they got the title which means I received no check and they took the car with my prescription sunglasses still in it.  If they would have called I would have had someone meet them get my sunglasses out of the car handed them the title and get my check. I called car brain told them where in the car the title was. I was assured by car brain that the next morning they would be dropping off my glasses and my check. I left instructions were to leave these items. All they left were my sunglasses because they didn't have the title because nobody passed the message on. Then I get a call from Carport basically giving me the riot act for not having a title. They're the ones that pretty much stole my car!He was threatening me. I finally  stated if his people had done what I asked and what they told me they were going to do none of this would have happened and it was on him and his staff.So Carbrain rocked.  The company that ended up buying my car definitely has some work to do.",15 avril 2019,4

I would highly recommend them to anyone of my relatives or friends looking to sell a vehicle.",04 avril 2019,5
"I first called ""Cash for Junk Cars"" aka Pick & Pull, and they wanted to charge ME $53 to pick up my car!  So I searched the internet for other options.  I ""clicked"" on the first one and entered the info but didn't get a response.  I continued to the next one, which was CarBrain, entered my info and immediately got an offer of $150! The scheduled pick-up day was delayed due to a heavy snow storm, (which is understandable), but I was able to continue communicating with CarBrain via email and text.  The vehicle was picked-up at the first break in the weather. The tow truck driver was so amicable!  CarBrain was very professional and knowledgeable.  They advised me to submit a Release of Liability with the California DMV which is crucial so you don't get charged registration, late fees, etc.  Overall, it was a positive experience and I  highly recommend them!",03 avril 2019,5
There were several issues with the pickup and the schedule towing. It was very frustrating and complicated trying to schedule things during the workday. I can‚Äôt take a day off just to meet a tow truck driver that might show up in a 4 hour window. Also the price paid was nothing short of an insult.,18 mars 2019,2
The process was quick and easy. They explained everything I needed to do. I got the price range I was looking for. The only thing was the tow truck driver did arrive later than the estimated time.,15 mars 2019,4

"Using the software, getting the offer, accepting it and coordinating the pickup over the phone all worked very well.  I think I got a decent price.  The friction happened when I was told the tow truck would arrive between 8 a.m. and noon.  I heard nothing until 12:15, when he called.  Then he arrived at 1:30 p.m.  I had arranged my schedule that day to be available for a four hour window and had to scramble a bit when things changed.",01 mars 2019,5

"Very quick service! The motor on my Camry just blew two weeks ago, leaving me with the ultimatum to sell it or repair it. The cost to repair was too expensive so I decided to sell it instead. The offers I got in person were much lower than what I got from CarBrain! Finding CarBrain was my last ditch effort in feeling comfortable selling my vehicle and I'm grateful for the prompt service and attention!Bill was the agent assisting me. Everything was done via texts, which made it very convenient given day-to-day challenges of going to a physical location. In less than a day, I sold my vehicle and received the check! I will caution though, the towing company who came didn't know how much to write the check out for, so I had to show him the email for confirmation. Initially, when I gave him the keys, he said thanks as if he had no intention of paying me, so I found that a bit odd. All in all, this was a great and seamless experience for me. I was able to cash the check at my bank right afterward so there were no issues. Great job, CarBrain!",16 janvier 2019,5
I had the best experience. Could not have been easier.Thank you CarBrain.,16 janvier 2019,5
I was quite impressed with the ease of this transaction. My car was picked up on time and the driver was very professional. I accidentally locked my keys in the car and he was able to open the door without any problem or damage to recover them. Very helpful. I would certainly recommend CarBrain to anyone needing to sell a slightly damaged vehicle. They gave me a fair price for mine.,09 janvier 2019,5
Easy initial contact and received a quote. Car was picked up within 2 days and my check was delivered.,05 janvier 2019,5
"For the perceived convenience, I opted to use Car Brain.  I sold two cars because I was in an accident and needed money.  Although carbrain lowballed me on both and then took more out of my pocket after accepting their offer, I went on thinking it would have me paid in the 48-72 hours as claimed.  It‚Äôs been a month and I received a payment for one of the vehicles a week ago and I‚Äôm still waiting for the second. I‚Äôve spoken to several representatives and two supervisors with seemingly no accountability. Had I waited this long and sat on the cars I could have much better options.  Boo.. 2 thumbs way down",31 d√©cembre 2018,5

I had never sold a car to a company like this before, and I am glad I chose CarBrain to do so with!",19 d√©cembre 2018,5
"The only issue is there was no room for negotiation on the price for the salvage. Other than that, I have recommended this service to others that have had to dispose of salvaged vehicles.",18 d√©cembre 2018,5
Selling my car to CarBrain was easy and straightforward! Getting a price quotes online was a great feature because it gave me a chance to review all of my options before selecting a company. I was offered a good rate and they picked my car up at no additional charge. Thank you!,18 d√©cembre 2018,4
"I will never use CarBrain again. My offer priced decreased once I agreed to use their service, and it took four attempts for them to pick up the vehicle. Once they didn't show up and twice they came while I was out of town. The fourth time was finally successful. I will never use a CarBrain again nor will I ever recommend anyone else to use them.",16 d√©cembre 2018,5
Quick response and great guidance through the entire process.,15 d√©cembre 2018,5
I'm giving Nancy Crum of CarBrain 5 stars. CarBrain the company might want to hold their vendors to a bit higher standards. Ms. Crum had to arrange a second vendor to pick up my car after the first vendor's tow truck ended up needing repairs. Ms. Crum was always very responsive to my e-mails or phone calls.,14 d√©cembre 2018,1

"Had an auto with a blown engine. I thought it would be impossible to sell. After a couple of weeks and no interest in the vehicle I came across a Car Brain ad on Google. The ad stated that they buy cars with blown engines. I contacted them. The process is quick and easy. Send them the Vin#, and some photos of the car. After that you wil get bids on the vehicle. Pick the offer you like. Once I got an offer i lked I took a snapshot of the signed title with my smart phone and sent it to them via my phone and they sent a tow truck and the driver with the cashiers check,  and Bam! Car sold and gone from my driveway and money in the bank! I highly recommend Car Brain if you want to get rid of an auto quickly. It was less than 48 hours - I had my cash.",12 d√©cembre 2018,5

"I think CarBrain did pretty well; the local branch that picked up my car (eventually) and paid me (eventually) was awful. CarBrain was mostly diligent, except when they didn't inform me that the local branch cancelled the pickup of my car. From that point on, the headache was almost entirely with the local folks. CarBrain did a nice job wrangling with them, and they were very attentive to my needs.  Most important, they made sure I got the check.  Thanks, CarBrain!",11 d√©cembre 2018,3
"To this date, more than 2 months after they came to take my car, I have not received a title transfer notification and nobody answers my messages.",11 d√©cembre 2018,3

Since the transaction took place in another state (Ohio)and I live in Michigan, I needed a copy of the title transfer and then had to call the office in Florida to have them email a copy to me since the pick-up guy didn't have that info.

I was called twice saying they had an emergency pick up and I live 35 minutes from where the car was to be picked up from. They were very nice once they arrived but I was on hold for over 10 hours as my window was 9-3, and I was finally taken care of at 7:00 pm. I was apologized to and told they did not notice the 3:00 latest time notation, though I had called their customer service 2 times...Even with this discrepancy I enjoyed the transaction with Car Brain and have already passed the word to associates.0.3",04 d√©cembre 2018,4

"I NEVER write a review for anything to me it‚Äôs a waste of time; however, I had such a bad experience with car brain that if this review helps even one person stay away from this company then it‚Äôs worth my time.I went through the long process of getting a quote for me car. I received a quote for $900 for my 2003 Mazda 6 (good condition everything works ). Fine, I waited a few days later for someone from car brain to call me and say ‚Äú we had a computer glitch and the offer you got of $900 was an computer error! ‚Äú and she went on to say they can‚Äôt find any buyers in my area for my car.This was obviously a flat out lie. Plus I live in NYC and a Mazda 6 is a popular car! AVOID THIS COMPANY THEY ARE LIARS!!! They will waste your time. Call your local junk yards instead. Also be aware of one more trick they do to  manipulate people. Watch out for a reply from them to this review attempting to explain themselves in a nice polite manner. DONT LISTEN TO THEM ITS MORE LIES!!! DONT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE!Thanks ! Have a nice day ....",04 d√©cembre 2018,5

I haggled with them for a few days and they brought it up, but I still didn't feel confident.I decided to do some more research, and came across CarBrain. Their offer was the amount I was looking for. They honored their offer when the car was picked up. Other places told me that other companies will offer one price then try to negotiate you down when they come to pick up the car, that did not happen with CarBrain!They handled everything! Please, please be sure to give them a chance to give you an offer on your car before you settle!Thank you so much for making this a simple and fast transaction!!",21 novembre 2018,5

"CarBrain is fine, and they were responsive and efficient. However, I am sorry to say that Copart, the towing company they partner with is anything but. They told me they would be picking my car up two days in a row, and two days in a row they canceled, and I made arrangements to be off work both days for no reason. Every time you call Copart you have to wait at least 15 minutes on hold, and it's an extremely frustrating experience. Based on this, I cannot recommend CarBrain. While the offer was good, the frustration of dealing with Copart is not worth it.",20 novembre 2018,2

"Very interesting experience. Selling my scrap car online was waaaaay out of my comfort zone, however everything has gone well and as of today (5 days post sale) the money is still in my account. They offered the best deal I could find by over double any of the other offers I had (dealer offered me 500 and my mechanic offered me 300). Definitely would recommend, although keep in contact with the regional partner they can be more disorganized then the CarBrain staff",21 septembre 2018,5
CarBrain was so easy to deal with. Get up on their web site put all the information in get a quote and the response was awesome. Call the towing company set up a time and they were great right on time cash in hand and they gone!!!!!,21 septembre 2018,5

The purchase of my vehicle was not what I expected but better than the rest I spoke with.,19 septembre 2018,4
"Since I can't give two ratings, I have to leave this at 3 stars.  However, if I could leave two ratings, I would say 5 stars for the actual deal, but 1 star for the follow through.  The process to transfer the vehicle and payment was painfully slow once all the necessary documents and price negotiations were complete.  Coordination between the main office and our local city office was sub par.",19 septembre 2018,3
"Awesome experience! Delilah (the associate buyer) was GREAT!I cannot emphasize enough how helpful and patient Delilah Domenech, the Associate Buyer, was with me as she walked me through the entire process. Her service and great attitude really made the transaction easy: I recently sold a truck with a blown engine to CarBrain. I was a bit nervous about selling the vehicle over the internet, but I have to tell you that CarBrain's process was very easy, and I was very satisfied with the price.Unfortunately for me, the truck I sold still had an outstanding loan balance greater than the CarBrain offer, but all I had to do was pay the balance down to the CarBrain offer, and they handled all of the paperwork to pay off the loan and get the title directly form the bank. When the deal was finalized, all I had to do was schedule a time for them to send a tow truck to pick up the vehicle (which they paid for).",19 septembre 2018,5
"Very helpful, quick (timely)and professional. Very friendly and helpful!",19 septembre 2018,5
Fast very polite. The deal was easy and fast.,19 septembre 2018,5

I thought carbrain was too good to be true... but it is true!!!! Excellent experience!,19 septembre 2018,5
Was at first reluctant to sell car online but after talking with them they were totally professional and did all the work. Car Brain will definitely be who i call when i need this type of service again. Thanks,19 septembre 2018,5
Working with Carbrain was an easy experience that helped me out of a jam!,19 septembre 2018,5
"I couldn't have asked for a much easier way of getting rid of my car, which needed a new engine. The whole process was quite straightforward and price quoted was very reasonable. Michael was super responsive and made sure that the whole thing went smoothly. No issues with getting the payment. I would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to get rid of their less than perfect car.",19 septembre 2018,5
"Mike from Carbrain was awesome. All questions were answered and all steps went smoothly. No complaints,  Highly recommended!",19 septembre 2018,4
"We were extremely pleased with CarBrain. The process was easy and customer service excellent.   After learning our car needed an engine replacement that would cost more than the car was worth, we thought we would just have to cut our losses.  CarBrain purchased the car from us for a fair price making a bad circumstance bearable. I recommend them without reservation.",19 septembre 2018,5
Mike was so patient and understanding and walked me through the whole process!!!!,19 septembre 2018,5

Straight forward.  Trustworthy.,18 septembre 2018,5
"The people who pick up the cars need to tell those giving up their car/title what to expect. I panicked when the DMV told me never to give my title up without seeing that it is transferred out of my name, as I would be paying taxes on it forever.",18 septembre 2018,5
"I received the best price for my junk van that‚Äôs motor had died. The process was easy-they made a good offer, I accepted and the tow truck picked it up! As painless as such an annoyance could be!",18 septembre 2018,5
"they did what they said, all good.",18 septembre 2018,4
Carbrain.com  contacted me after I put an ad on Craigslist about a car that I was going to sell as junk. They offered  me a fair market price for my vehicle which was more than I was asking for on Craigslist. made the arrangements to pick up my car gave me a check on the spot . when I call them up the next day to tell them that I left my garage remote control in the sun visor they told me it was not a problem and they mailed it out to me UPS the next day. I would highly recommend this company to anyone who has a problem vehicle and doesn't know what to do with it.,18 septembre 2018,5
The transaction went smooth as can be. I was very pleased and satisfied with the driver Steve who came to pick up the vehicle. Also with the customer service of all the staff involved with the steady communication from the initial inquiring to the actual pick up of the vehicle.I would like to thank you for a great experience with the whole transaction. I would recommend your services to anyone needing a reference for the selling of their vehicle or if I decide to sell any other vehicles that I may own in the future.,18 septembre 2018,5
Got 3 quotes and Car Brain was higher by $200. A couple of friends were doubtful this was even legit. Guy arrived on time with check in hand as agreed. Can‚Äôt ask for anything more. Thank you!,18 septembre 2018,5
"This is a great company!!! Great customer service! Friendly, efficient and available after hours and on weekends . I highly recommend anyone who needs to get rid of a car to give this company an opportunity!",18 septembre 2018,4
Had a great vehicle with only needing a transmission on it but unfortunately the offer price wasn't what I was expecting.  Super low ball.  I would warn other future customers about the process.  But the rest of the process was quick and professional.,18 septembre 2018,5
I would recommend to everyone I‚Äôm a very happy customer,18 septembre 2018,5
Stumbled across Car Brain after an unfortunate event. I was thrilled with the results,18 septembre 2018,5

"A joke and waste of time. I have a good running, reliable pickup that I want to sell. My wife passed away, my kids are grown and have vehicles, grandkids won't be driving for another 13 years. These clowns say the buy vehicles anywhere but the answer I got was { sorry nobody in your area is interested in your good running, reliable truck.} Even though I live in a rural farming community where the mountains aren't far away either. I should have known nobody around here wouldn't be interested in a 4X4 pickup.",18 septembre 2018,1
They rip people off no matter the Make and Model they will give you chump change for you vehicle! Need to sell a working vehicle don‚Äôt ever trust or go to Carbrain.,15 septembre 2018,1
"Couldn't have gone smoother.  Most of the transaction was done by text, with a couple of e-mails thrown in.  They followed up by phone the day before the pick up.The pick-up was on time and also went smoothly.  The driver called about 30 minutes ahead of time to make sure he had the correct address and that the car was ready.  The check cleared the bank within 24 hours.  And the amount paid was well above what any of the local junkyards were willing to pay.  As they say, this was 'stupid easy'.  Thanks for a great experience.",14 septembre 2018,5
"They got back to me after leaving a message, but I didn't know it was only an answering service.  I was worried that they were going to change the offer price when they got there, but it couldn't have gone any smoother.",13 septembre 2018,4
"My car barely ran, was 15 years old, and looked... not good. I wanted to sell it quick without the hassle of searching for a buyer.  Carbrain gave me a quote, I accepted, a couple days later the buyer picked it up and I was done.",08 septembre 2018,5
"CarBrain made this incredibly easy and painless. My car blew up months before I was planning on trading it in with barely 65,000 miles on it and thanks to them it wasn't a complete loss for me.",08 septembre 2018,5
"Selling my car online was definitely out of my comfort zone, but CarBrain walked me through the process. I have to admit there was a little hand holding along the way too. I think it would benefit CarBrain to explain in more depth their business model as the middle person who brokers the sale of your car to a car auction company. It took me several phone calls to figure that out. I would recommend CarBrain to anyone who has a less than perfect car. They gave me a fair price without the hassle of trying to sell a car that broke down in my driveway and ultimately became too expensive to fix.",04 septembre 2018,5
The process was easy and quick. The offer was more than other sites I looked at. Customer service from Katie was excellent. I would definitely recommend CarBrain if you have a vehicle that you want to get rid of.,03 septembre 2018,5
Good experience,03 septembre 2018,5
"The communication between Carbrain, the tow company, and myself was poor. The tow company didn‚Äôt call back to confirm an appointment, then came on a day I asked them not to, even when I had also told my Carbrain rep, Nancy, to make sure they didn‚Äôt come that day. After we rescheduled, they showed up on the right day, but didn‚Äôt knock on the door. Instead they hooked my car up and took it away without giving me a check or taking the pink slip. I had to call them back out (for the third time) to pay me and take the pink slip, But I was happy with how easy the offer process was and that Nancy followed up throughout the process",01 septembre 2018,3
Excellent!  No reservations whatsoever.   I would recommend this company to anyone!!Katie Jones facilitated the transaction - she was professional and helpful....and patient with me and my questions!,30 ao√ªt 2018,5
"I sold my BMW 2012 X5, with a bad engine  and the entire process was seemless. I got a quote and we negotiated and agreed on price. They closed out the loan with my bank of which I had outstanding payment and received the title. They provide a tow truck to pick up the car, without me needing to be there. I would definitely recommend anyone selling there car to use Carbrain. They are the best!",30 ao√ªt 2018,5
"Very bad experience.. The worst of the worst! Customers services terrible, chat between 45-1hr waiting. After( two days waiting, after got an offer) I called, from Michael, to Nancy, to ( don‚Äôt get the name)......40 minutes later talked with ‚ÄúSupervisor Frank‚Äù....  to change everything about it, shocking between offers to the reality. Company hidden information and lack of professionalism ways to customers.  Don‚Äôt do business with Carbrain; do better business with KBB and there‚Äôs Instant offer....more profesional and real good offer..!!!",30 ao√ªt 2018,1
The whole experience went as smooth as the website described. Everything was wrapped up quickly and got a very fair price for our car.,28 ao√ªt 2018,5
I was totallly  impressed with Katie and her associates performance and professionalism.,28 ao√ªt 2018,5
The experience was easy and I received my offer the same day. The reason I gave a 4 is because the tow company picked my car up and didn‚Äôt retrieve the title or give me my check.( driver didn‚Äôt follow instructions) I had to drive 35 mins to go retrieve my check and give the title.,26 ao√ªt 2018,5
"Quick, professional, convenient. What else do you need? If you don't want the hassle of selling a junk car just go through this.",25 ao√ªt 2018,4

They offered me $420 to $750 for my 2008 madza 6 which I drive everyday.  Nothing at all wrong with it except for needing a cleaning.  It's valve is about $3000 according to KBB.  This company is a ripoff.,22 ao√ªt 2018,5
Would have given 5 stars if I could have been given what the vehicle is truly worth.  I would like to have received $2000.00 more but that didn't happen.,21 ao√ªt 2018,5

CarBrain was great. They made it super easy to sell our junk car and we got a great price. Dealerships told us they would give us $100 for a trade! So happy we went with CarBrain instead. I was skeptical because it seemed to good to be true. I mean they were going to come and pick up the car for us and give us money? But they were for real! Car gone. Money deposited. Very happy with this company.,15 ao√ªt 2018,5

I just accepted the offer, provided the owner certificates, and arranged a time for them to pickup the car with a check pay me ready. Katie was very nice and helpful.",11 ao√ªt 2018,5
"Great experience from the beginning.  I was a bit concerned about giving the car, keys and title to a stranger before receiving and cashing the check.  I was given a link to reviews (both BBB and personal) as well as a copy of the check so I could verify the account and funds before handing over the title.  Car Brain was very accommodating, and eager to put me at ease.  The tow truck showed up on time.  Funds cleared the bank.",11 ao√ªt 2018,5

"I almost never do positive reviews but felt compelled to do so because this can be a trying process. First of all, I am so glad I went with Carbrain over Peddle. Bill was attentive and helpful. He offered to communicate however I wanted, even text message. He even helped me get a better offer when Peddle tried to swoop in. Thankfully Peddle‚Äôs reviews are terrible. The towing service Carbrain set me up with worked with me to make sure the transaction went as smoothly as possible.",10 ao√ªt 2018,5
Thank you so so much! My car has been picked up along with the title and I received the payment just as proposed. I never thought it would be this easy or that I would possibly get any payment like that for my car.

"Easy to work with company, they do all the work. Be sure to snap some photos of your vehicle to send to them for best price. They offered me almost double the highest offer I got from other buyers.

Their Nancy Crum handled my transaction from start to finish,  she is the best.",07 ao√ªt 2018,5
"I had the loss of a family member the same week my Lexus RX350‚Äôs engines seized. Unable to deal with much the carbrain option seemed ideal.

And when finialize is compete it don't take them long to get it. don't have wonder if it going to be pick like they get u or it got to seat for months and get a the run around.

Nancy is respondant quite fast and kind whenever I asked something concerning car selling.,27 juillet 2018,5
I almost did not write this but it bothers me more than ever when I am told something and then nothing. After speaking with Rodger I was told that I would receive a gift card for my trouble and would follow up with me. I hung up thinking it was nice that were sending the gift card and the fast response. Well it has been almost 2 weeks ago and nothing. I understand stand things happen and people are busy but don't say your going to do something and not fallow through.,27 juillet 2018,5

Nancy was very helpful and answered all my questions,18 juillet 2018,5

"This was the first time I ever had to sell a car to this kind of place.  This car had been my great friend for 16 years. Her name was Yasuko, named after a former student.  Nancy was very kind and explained everything so I knew what to expect. The truck that came to pick Yasuko up had just been washed.  It was a fine farewell to my friend.  My brother, who works as a police officer was interested in CarBrain, as he often is asked if he knows where to call for a wrecked car.  I was happy to give them Nancy's information.  Thanks, Nancy!",18 juillet 2018,5
Simple and fast - thank you!,18 juillet 2018,5
Katie helped us every step of the way. She made the process easy and less painful. I would recommend CarBrain to family and friends anytime.,18 juillet 2018,5

Awesome  everything was as promised,13 juillet 2018,5

I reached out to her again last week and she gladly helped me get the same great offer I had at the end of April. Very thankful for her time walking me through the process, it was truly painless!",13 juillet 2018,5
"Even though they didn't show up on the day they were supposed to, they truly made up for it the following day. They have a very professional and courteous staff. They worked with me when I didn't have the proper paper work, giving me suggestions on how to move forward.",13 juillet 2018,5
"This sale was easy, and the amount we were offered was fair.  They didn't offer a high amount to get our attention and then lower it when all the details were in.  They gave a range and then the price they offered after seeing pictures was about the middle of the offer.  The actual sale was easy, and they were very accommodating when scheduling pick up.",13 juillet 2018,5
"Quick easy and legit. When our car engine went unexpectedly during a stressful time, it was nice to have this process done easily.",12 juillet 2018,5

"Great experience overall. I was able to sell my 2010 GMC Acadia (which had a blown motor) for a fair price. Katie was very friendly and helpful. It was super easy to get an offer via their webdite. Once the transaction was complete, buyer called to schedule a pick up. Agreed to sale price on a Friday, buyer came with a tow truck and a check Monday. I handed over keys and title for a check and it was a done deal. I highly recommend them. Actually I was scared it was a scam but after some research and seeing their BBB rating I felt better. They are legitimate and although I hope to never need them again lol, I am grateful to have found them. Thank you for everything!",11 juillet 2018,5
They gave me a fair price for my car.  Once I was ready the car was picked up the next day with an immediate check.  Nancy was great.,11 juillet 2018,5

Kinda cheap but friendly staff and quick response to pick up,09 juillet 2018,4
They don‚Äôt give you an exact time to pick the car up. The driver I had didn‚Äôt understand English like at all. And after multiple phone calls they still didn‚Äôt spell my name right on the check. Still jumping through hoops to get the money.,09 juillet 2018,2
Great experience! Katie was great. She explained the process and everything went smoothly.,08 juillet 2018,5
"Thank you, Nancy.  Nancy worked with my Mom and me to get the payoff correct with Credit Union.  The bride loan did not work out so we lost some time.  Nancy worked with us through a relatively long delay.  We needed to pay down to the agreed payoff, which we did, but Credit Union internal rules made it difficult to get a confirmation payoff letter as needed by CarBrain.  Once I was able to get it paid down and gave Nancy the contact, she was able to work with them to get what they needed.",06 juillet 2018,5
"Carbrains is a great concept & trustworthy company. They helped to make an unexpected accident a profitable event. Nancy was very kind and professional, I would like to thank her for a wonderful overall experience.Highly recommend Carbrains.",05 juillet 2018,5
"It took me a couple of months to handle the situation with my salvage title car. I worked with two different CarBrain representatives over that period and both were responsive and consistent over time.

The team really came though, I would recommend this service to friends and family.",05 juillet 2018,5

"You guys picked up my car from my mechanic without telling me and gave the check to my mechanic. Then forgot to get the title because you took the car without me being there. So I had to travel to drop my title 40miles from my house. Then since you took the car without me there my car tags were still on my car. The salvage yard wouldnt allow me to take them off myself, instead they ripped off my plates and destroyed them and refused to help me with getting them replaced. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone to your company.",03 juillet 2018,5
First time using CarBrain and I would be happy to recommend.,03 juillet 2018,1

Fast response no waiting for pick up of vehicle,02 juillet 2018,5
"Very easy to deal with. They originally made a lower offer, but after sending pictures and giving the the price we wanted, they met that price. We didn't have unreasonable expectations though. It was an easy sale and we didn't have to deal with tire kickers. A+ Just schedule the pick up time and they show up to take your car. The only issue I had was they have a 5 hour time window, so it made the day difficult to schedule anything.",02 juillet 2018,5
Thought I was going her lowballed but they offered the best price and arrived with a check.  Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.,02 juillet 2018,5

I got almost five times what I was offered by my local scrap yard for a Toyota Tundra that was nothing more than an eyesore for me.

"This company appears to be a complete scam.  We sent them all of the information that they requested including a copy of the title and they never showed up.  The called and said they were on their way, we waited for over 3 hours, called and could not reach anyone.UPDATE: They finally showed up after 2 days and having to make a few phone calls. On the next business day they called and apologized. They appeared to be as upset as we were with what had happened.  They also sent up ""compensation"" for our time and energy wasted. Not sure what to think.",02 juillet 2018,5

As advertised. Very easy to work with and no surprise.,29 juin 2018,5
"People at carbrain, in my case in particular Michael Rodriguez, are very helpful, professional and patient. However, the tow-companies that they work with, when it comes to picking up your car on time, can be unreliable. My car pick-up date kept on being delayed and was eventually picked up 2 days later than the original date. However overall it is a good company and they give you a fair price on your car even if it doesn't start anymore, and the towing is for free! We also live in a remote place, so most probably it would have been more challenging to sell the old car for parts without this company. So thank you carbrain!",28 juin 2018,5

"I want to take this opportunity to thank Nancy Crum for the wonderful service she provided on my damaged Lexus. I did an online quote and Nancy follow up with emails and phone calls. Despite some unexpected complications in dealing with the insurance companies and valuation of the vehicle, carbrain was willing to accomodate and adjust to help make it a smooth process. Nancy took care of the whole thing and I felt I received great service during the whole process.Dealing with Carbrain is much better than dealing with Copart which is also the insurance company default salvage vehicle auctioneer. Thumbs up for Carbrain.",26 juin 2018,5

"Selling a vehicle to CarBrain was simple, quick and seamless. The associate I dealt with was very professional and kind. If you are selling a vehicle you should definitely consider CarBrain.",22 juin 2018,5
"Great experience with this company. I didn't know what to expect and theirprofessionalism was above my expectations. The only reason I did not rate them any higher than I did is because they said they were take the car no matter what shape it was in - so they quoted me a price - and then when they saw a picture of it - they reduced the amount of the offer and I thought that really wasn't fair, because they said they buy ""junk' cars....what difference did the appearance make ?  So for that reason, I felt a little bit ""ripped off"" but the overall price was still pretty good. And the overall process was good. And all the people were very professional and prompt in replying.",21 juin 2018,5
"I will definitely be recommending Carbrain! The website was very smooth and easy to use, very intuitive. The whole process was made very easy and super quick! I even feel we received a fair value for a car that I anticipated would be a complete pain to get rid of.",20 juin 2018,5

Great deal on the car. Quick to respond and free towing.,20 juin 2018,5
"Great customer service, very quick response time and a great quote comparing to other places. I was very hesitant to use Car Brain because their offer sounded just too good and everything was done through text, but I couldn't be any happier with the final outcome. My car had a 'cooked' engine and local places were offering me from $150 to $450 which was ridiculous. Car Brain first said $1050 but after I sent them some pictures they increased it to $1200. I called them on Thursday and the car was picked up and paid for on Monday morning. Also, they work with Copart which is a huge reliable company organizing car auctions, which made me more comfortable doing business with them.If you have a broken car I would definitely recommend selling it to Car Brain.",20 juin 2018,5
"Overall is good. towing is slow,",19 juin 2018,5
"Fast service. Great experience. No hassle.After I filled out the form and provided my car VIN, I got a call and text from Nancy. She was extremely helpful and provided me all the information I needed to know. The quote was also good.The documents and pictures of my car, I was able to text to Nancy. That was very convenient. The process was completed in no time.I got my car sold at a good price and they were able to tow it the next day.I would definitely use CarBrain next time I need to sell my car.Thank you for all the help!",15 juin 2018,5
"After entering all the details in their website, they later did not appear in the offer, which led tow company to decline on the basis that car was not accurately described. This after many many calls from them urging to send pictures of the car and the title. Their correct name should be ""CarBrain...dead""",14 juin 2018,1
"Delilah was very helpful throughout the whole process, and made everything easy.",14 juin 2018,5
It was great only one thing i couldn't get my things out of trunk of the car but everything else was fine,14 juin 2018,5
Horrible! They suggested to sell my 1995 GMC Yukon to a junkyard and were very ignorant the age of the vehicle despite the fact the site clearly states they DO NOT care about such things. I feel as if I am being discriminated against here. Do all of these companies treat their less privileged customers like crap or is it just me? Very discouraging to be treated so poorly when already struggling so much.,13 juin 2018,1
"The service was great until the drive never showed up to pick up my car in the 3 hour window they provided me. I took a day off to make sure I was available. The driver called me 3 hours after the set time expiration to see if I was still available and blamed it on the office not scheduling when I think he just didnt have time or care.  Plus since he missed it on the Friday, I had to pay for the parking spot I had my car located in for an additional 5 days until they scheduled for the next pick up. The didn't seem to care about the lack of service.I was contacted by the team at Carbrain which helped me with making the pick up issue corrected. They were very professional and eager to help. I would recommend them to anyone looking to go through this process.",13 juin 2018,4
Working with Katie at carbrain made selling our car simple and stress free.,13 juin 2018,5
Nancy was prompt with replies and helpful throughout the process. The only poor experience was working with the local company to pick up the vehicle. They did not arrive as promised on 3 occasions.,12 juin 2018,5
I was amazed at how easy Nancy and the team at CarBrain made the process of selling my car. Yes I would recommend them and Nancy Crum deserves a raise!!!,12 juin 2018,4
The experience was awesome!  I called around to local junkyards and was offered basically nothing for my vehicle.  I stumbled upon your website and gave it a chance.  I was very happy with the offer that came back. It was so incredibly easy to do and Nancy and Mike were the best.  I have been telling everyone about my great experience.  Thank you CarBrain.com.,12 juin 2018,5

"Nancy from CarBrain was very helpful and informative during the transaction of my vehicle.  The process was very straight forward and smooth.  Nancy was very available to answer my questions via email, text, or phone.  Her colleagues were very helpful as well and I was very happy with the entire experience.  We were able to work out a fair deal for my car that had over 200k miles and needed some work.  Others were not too interested in my car, but CarBrain wanted to work with me.  I highly recommend their service for anyone looking to sell a car with high miles and needing some repairs.  Thank you Nancy and CarBrain!",11 juin 2018,5
I had a great experience with CarBrain!  It was quick and easy to get my car traded in for cash and it was more cash than I was offered by any dealership or other online group.  Kudos to Delilah as she was very thorough and helpful through the entire process.  I would highly recommend CarBrain!,11 juin 2018,5
Working with carbrain.com was fast and easy. I needed to sell a totaled car. This was the easiest way to do it. I shopped around and they found me the highest bid.

Katie was very professional and helpful  throughout the whole  process. I would highly recommend CarBrain  to anyone looking to sell their  used or damage to vehicle.,09 juin 2018,5
"I really want to give them a fair shot unfortunately they failed to deliver.I was reassured by all the positive reviews but I had a terrible experience as follow.I was promised by their local partner (COPART) that my car can be picked up today, given that I will be on call till 6pm. Since I wanted to get rid of this car ASAP, I said yes and took the day off from work. I watched my phone all day, making sure I don't miss anything. At 2pm, I checked in and they said the driver is on their way. I didn't think much of it, so I didn't really ask for a phone number (in retrospect, BIG MISTAKE). At 5:05pm, I called again and their phone line is dead. Their voicemail box is also full (what does that say?). I called CarBrain and their response is basically - Sorry, we cannot do anything. I'm beyond frustrated because I waited from 10am-6pm ALL DAY to get no response. I'm really hoping the driver is on their way and is just really bad at updating their customer. However it is already close to 7pm now.",09 juin 2018,5

"Katie is a great representative. She made it super easy and clear what I had to do on my part. She kept me in updated and reminded me what the next step was when I would forget. When I was also looking at other businesses, she called me to see if I was still interested. The other companies (Whom I'm not going to list out of respect) I was looking into didn't have the persistance as Katie did. The other places only sent out one email and I quickly forgot about them. Katie really helped me to sell it faster and to choose Carbrain/Copart.",06 juin 2018,4
"I was at a loss - not knowing what to do with my totalled car. The total time taken from filling the form online to the actual pick up and payment was less than two days. Bill was very prompt in responding to emails and calls. Considering I came across CarBrain through Google search, I am pleased with the overall transaction.CarBrain has a nice setup and I find them trust worthy.",05 juin 2018,5
"Started out a good, quick experience.  Set up to pick up the car the next morning.  When no one contacted me about the pickup I was told it would be sometime next week.  I explained this was unacceptable and set up a pickup for the next day.  Next day, no pickup.  When I called I was told that it wouldn't be until sometime next week.  I called carbrain and they said that they couldn't/wouldn't make any other arrangements.  I told them they obviously didn't want my business and I would find someone else who was more reliable.UPDATE:  After posting this review I received a call from the COO of Carbrain who said they would make this right and schedule a pickup on Tuesday morning (Monday was a holiday).  I agreed to give them another chance.  Fast forward to Tuesday morning.  I receive a call from a nice young lady who said she was going to schedule a pickup sometime this week.  I told her this was unacceptable and that I needed it picked up today.  She said she couldn't schedule ""same day"" pickup.  I explained in no uncertain terms that this was NOT a same day pickup, that it has been almost a week.  She said there was nothing she could do.  In short, this has gone from good to bad to good to bad.UPDATE 2  Carbrain's COO again reached out to me to try to make things right.  He was most kind and seemed like he wanted to do right by me.  I had by this time however, made other arrangements for the car.  Although we couldn't do business this time, I do appreciate his efforts and am impressed at how quickly he responds to customer issues.  Maybe next time.",01 juin 2018,5
"Carbrain and Nancy C were awesome with getting me a square price on my Ford Edge. Nancy even went to bat for me and got me near my asking price after I sent her pictures of the automobile. Scheduling a pickup was easy and the tow truck driver showed up on time, with a check for the agreed upon price and took care of removing the vehicle. Should I ever have another vehicle that needs a new home, I will call Carbrain. Well done.",31 mai 2018,5

"Great Service - As Promised.  Highly recommend.  Easy - everything done via text or on their very easy to understand website.  Delilah very easy to work with and very responsive.  Check amount of $1,500 for my very old car was $1,000 higher than 3 other quotes.",25 mai 2018,5
"If you are skeptical...please read this! So, I had an 09 SUV that ran okay but it had a decent sized dent in the front, 180,000 miles and then the ignition cylinder decided to lock up so I couldn't even start it.  I knew it was time for a new vehicle and someone I knew told me they would ""take it off my hands"" for a small amount of money.  Then, I found Car Brain.  I was truly scared of the whole process.  Most was done via text between myself, Nancy and Delilah.  Send you a picture of my signed title?! Agree to hand over the title when they take my truck and not know if the check will clear?! WHAT?! I was nervous.  But, I rolled the dice anyway and could not be happier with the outcome.  Everything went as they said...got SO much more than I thought and yes, the check cleared LOL  I would absolutely 100% use them again.  And totally recommend anyone with a vehicle with issues to give them a shot! (Just completed this transaction May 2018 btw)",24 mai 2018,5

"Very easy and straightforward way to sell a broken car. You can put information and images about your car throught the website and get an instant offer. If you choose do try a different amount you can do. Then a representative will call you if there could be a raise of the offer. They offer free towing service which is nice. The tow driver will bring you a check.The only thing is that it took a little bit longer than I expect to get the Bill of Sale, which is a little more than a week. But this is minor and I don't need that so urgent so no problem at all.",10 mai 2018,4

Even the glitches, which always happen and I feel are a real test to a company's integrity and work ethic, were ironed out quickly. I truly can not recommend this company high enough. I had a feeling that there would be no hagglling or last minute glitches that would bring my price down and I was right. You can trust them to do the job right and you can say goodbye to sleezy car salesmen and women!",28 avril 2018,5
"it was a seamless transaction, however I was disappointed to see that the final number was lower than the given range.",28 avril 2018,5
"It was great dealing with you. Sold my car faster than I expected. Only one problem was when the person how picked up my car, did not process the check in same day! I had to call and make sure that it was a correct check. Thank you.",26 avril 2018,5
"Loved my experience on CarBrain!  I was juggling so much trying to repair my vehicle, determining it wasn't worth repairs, and looking for a new car all within the same week.  My father found CarBrain.com and everything sounded really good . . . but I was still very hesitant to add this to my already hectic schedule.  I am so glad that I took 10 minutes to read the FAQs on the CarBrain site.  I was still a little nervous about using the online service for what I considered a major transaction (boy, was I wrong) but was connected to a top notch representative to walk me through everything and help troubleshoot along the way (thank you Delilah!).  Everything was straight forward and QUICK!  Junked my car within 24 hours, got a check same day, and life keeps moving on.  I highly recommend CarBrain!",25 avril 2018,5

"A spark plug disintegrated in my Honda Fit after 150,000 miles, and it damaged the engine. Carbrain gave me an incredibly fair offer, and the transaction was being processed so efficiently that I was a bit suspicious and hesitant at first. This organization is incredible compared to trying to sell  a vehicle to a local salvage lot. I have been recommending them to everyone I know.",13 avril 2018,5

"It is always tough to trust online companies, but Carbrain was very much the exception. They made the process very easy and I was able to move from phase to phase with the help of Delilah who walked me through the process and even followed up after the process was complete. My only gripe if any was that the towing company could not give me an exact time, only a window for pickup.",10 avril 2018,5

"This company would be excellent for a non working junker car.  I guess they even come and how it away for you,  and most people seem to really like it for that. However, of your car runs, probabaly look elsewhere to sell it. I officially decided not to sell my vehicle to CarBrain due to an insulting low offer that they were unwilling to negotiate on ($6,000 for a 2016 Scion tC with only 6k miles on it. Seriously?). But it never hurts to get a quote and see what they're willing to give you!",04 avril 2018,5
Katie made the whole process very easy. Thank you carbrain.,04 avril 2018,3

Great help and followed up on all matters.,30 mars 2018,3
CarBrain was super easy to work with and they even waited until I could get the title to my car. Once I had it they were out to pick up the car a couple of days later with check in hand. I would definitely recommend them and I'm so glad I found them!,30 mars 2018,5

The thing I liked the most was how quick the whole process took, after I inquired about my vehicle it took less than 24 hours for the car to be picked up and for me to be paid.  Overall I would give this experience six stars if it were an option, also, I would more than likely recommend CarBrain to friends and family. Thank you very much!!!!",27 mars 2018,5

She helped me figure out a lot of details while I am trying to help my sister dispose her car and pointed me in the right direction as how to obtain needed documents. Once the documents were sent, the car was picked up instantly and check was mailed out right away. The owner ,Adele offered a great price which was more than what I expected. Delilah and the whole staff were very professional and helpful. I highly recommend CarBrain to anybody looking to dispose their car. Great Service!",16 mars 2018,5
They left me hanging without any contact whatsoever.  If my disabled junker isn't their cup of tea then just say so fer-cryin'-out-loud. My guess is that they are a broker that try to pass stuff down the line to used car lots.,16 mars 2018,5

Excellent transaction from beginning to end. Do recommend,04 mars 2018,5
"Everything went according to plan.  I would just recommend that there be a more formalized transaction process that is shared.  If a customer could print a sheet, ""Transaction:  This is what you can expect"" sheet showing:- Customer verifies title with Carbrain- Carbrain notifies customer of pickup contractor (with registration #)- Customer is expected to present title to pickup contractor- Pickup contractor is expected to present a check to customer...........",04 mars 2018,5

Excellent Service! Katie was prompt. She answered every question. Was honest about the process and what I could expect.

Thus was a no hassle no Brainer transaction.  We agreed on a price. ...set up a pickup time and we were done. ...very impressed,20 f√©vrier 2018,5
"Was offered almost nothing for my blown engine"", slightly body damaged mini cooper.  Car Brain was easy to use and offered me far more money than a trade in.  Did everything from my iphone and had a check in a few days.",18 f√©vrier 2018,5
Car Brain was wonderful! I could not sell my car because of the rusted frame and Car Brain was accommodating as well as simple. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is I wish I had gotten a little more for it-and I could not really determine how they figured out the price point. Awesome service though!! I definitely recommend!,14 f√©vrier 2018,5
This place was professional quick and very helpful would recommend this place you will get more from Car Brain then a dealership Trust Me I know!,13 f√©vrier 2018,4
Carbrain was very wonderful to work with. After entering details of my car I received an instant quote. Within an hour I got a call from the local company that would be picking my car up the same day. The guy showed up right on time and had the payment on hand. I would definitely use them again if I ever need to sell another car.,13 f√©vrier 2018,5
Efficient and offered a far better price than local salvage yards. Wish I‚Äôd discovered them sooner.,12 f√©vrier 2018,5
"I had a car that suffered a very expensive timing chain failure. Rather than spend $7k to fix a 6 year old car with 100K+ miles, I opted to sell it and get a new car. The dealer only offered $1000 towards the purchase of a new car. CarBrain gave me almost 2.5 times more for the car. Of course, because I wasn't expecting to buy a new car, I had some title issues to work out. They were so patient and worked with their local tow partner to store the car until I could get them the proper paperwork. They paid for overnight shipping of the title paperwork and my check. Top notch and would recommend to anyone!",12 f√©vrier 2018,5
Katie addressed all questions and handled the sale professionally,11 f√©vrier 2018,5
"This was a fast, seamless process with CarBrain. I tried calling local salvage places myself....but didn‚Äôt really know what to expect AND the quotes were less than half of what we got through CarBrain.  Thank you for making it easy!",11 f√©vrier 2018,5
"Not only did CarBrain give us the best price on our non-running car, but it was very efficient.   The whole process was handled over the internet.",11 f√©vrier 2018,5

I chose CarBrian because the rep I spoke with was easy to talk with. I felt at ease voicing my concerns doing business with them for the first time. I did not like idea of them taking my car away and leaving me with a piece of paper as I put it (the check).  He was very patient and understanding. He never tried to pressure me. He listened and gave me the necessary info I needed. I was given a quote and the quote was the same when my car was picked up. I took a day to think it over and everything remain as it was originally set up. the tow company driver and assistant were also pleasant to work with. The check cleared and I was extremely glad that they were trustworthy. Thank you.  CarBrian.  I do miss my car though!!!!!!,20 janvier 2018,4

It was significantly higher than offers from similar services. After accepting the offer, they quickly got me in touch with the buyer and helped me resolve a lien issue with the buyer. After that was resolved, the buyer picked up my car within 24 hours and I received payment on the spot.",19 janvier 2018,5
Had on my hands a vehicle with a bad engine.  Cost of new engine would be more than value of vehicle.  First reaction was to sell to a junk yard for a couple hundred of $.  Came across CarBrain while I was researching the internet on what to do with car.  What a find!  Got 4 to 5 times more for the car then I would had with the junk yard option.  Process was painless and Delilah was very responsive.  I highly recommend!,19 janvier 2018,5

"This was an excellent experience for us.  Bummed that the engine in my wife's 2008 mini Cooper Clubman blew after only 75k miles, we were suddenly stuck with a car that no one wanted.  Fortunately, my wife found this site.  It couldn't have been an easier process.  We entered the car's info, the VIN number and within about 10 seconds had an offer that was higher than we were offered for the trade-in on the car from the dealer!  We kicked it into high gear and within 2 days, it was towed (no expense to us) and there was a check in hand.We definitely have recommended this company to others already.",17 janvier 2018,4

"I went into this with some reservations as I'm sure many others will when trying to sell their car online. However, I can happily say CarBrain blew my expectations out of the water. Katie was ultra responsive to any questions or concerns I may have had and the process could not have been any easier to close the deal.That said, there was one down part to the process and that was the tow truck company that CarBrain contracted to collect my car. The tow company was less than stellar and left a lot to be desired. Fortunately, Katie was there every step of the way helping get it sorted so I can't fault CarBrain for the tow company's failings.",17 janvier 2018,5

CarBrain did a pretty good job getting me a fast quote and working through some pickup issues but the folks they use to schedule and pick up cars are totally unreliable.

"An expensive engine repair relegated my car to salvage status.  I knew nothing about how to sell such a car.  Found CarBrain via an online search and the reviews on Trustpilot.  Entered data about the car online.  A quote came within hours.  I spoke on the phone with both Nancy and Delilah -- both were very helpful.  Didn't even need to send pictures of the car or the odometer.  As long as your car matches the description/data you entered online, they stand by their quote.  My review is four stars instead of five because of a couple of glitches in the pick up of the car.  Tow truck was 2.5 hours later than the four hour window provided, and the driver didn't call the number he was supposed to call when he was one hour out.  Driver apologized profusely once he arrived and was very courteous.",16 janvier 2018,5

When I had issues contacting the tow company to set up for pick up, she personally called them and got someone for me to speak with. She was truly amazing and the process was very easy and streamlined. The only criticism I have which is nothing about Katie, is that your company she factor in for add insult and upgrades, for instance I had a factory installed entertainment system installed in my Lexus which could have been an added selling feature as well as more money to me... but I was happy to get the car off my hands quickly and get a decent price in doing so.",15 d√©cembre 2017,5

I had been assured that exchanging the car, title and keys for the check would happen, after we met at mechanic's, where the car was being stored.

The speed and ease with which our transaction was completed was absolutely fabulous.

This was one of the most hassle free experiences we've had.,15 novembre 2017,5
"The tow company that Car Brain utilized for Durham, NC sent a HORRENDOUS driver, who not only was HORRIBLY RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL, yet also terribly LATE!! The horrible tow truck driver called me a ""butt"" a number of times, and threatened to not give me my check a number of times. It was MORE THAN AN AWFUL EXPERIENCE!!!",15 novembre 2017,5

Even though I was skeptical it all worked out perfectly. I received exactly what I was quoted. I was able to arrange a time that suited me for the pickup of the car.

"Carbrain offered me more for my car than anywhere else I looked, and towed it for free. The sale was relatively easy, the site simple to navigate, and the staff understanding and helpful.My only problem was with the tow company they used to pick up my car. I was given a window from 8am-12pm that my car would be picked up during. At 3pm that day, I called the company and asked what the deal was, as no one had showed up. They said they'd be there around 5pm, now. At 9pm we got the call that they were on their way. When we got there, they didn't have a the check--hadn't even realized that they owed me one. This didn't seem to be a problem with the tow company, but with communication between Carbrain and the tow. Eventually, the next day at around 5pm, all was sorted out and my title was signed over with my check in hand.Overall I'm grateful for the amount Carbrain gave and the ease of the service.",26 octobre 2017,4
My experience with CarBrain was amazing. They made selling my car so simple. I would definitely recommend to anyone.,23 octobre 2017,5
"They were attentive to my calls and emails.  They showed up when they said they would, gave me my check (which cleared), and I was on my way.",21 octobre 2017,5

"I found the experience to be incredibly easy and fair.  All done on the internet until I spoke with Nancy.  The system gave me the quote, and Nancy walked me through the next steps.  There was a little snafu on who to make the check out to, however, we cleared it up on site and the exchange was made carefree.  If felt so easy, it almost didn't feel legit.Really recommend CarBrain!",18 octobre 2017,4
"Our car died while driving on the highway and had to have it towed to a local shop. Turns out the engine blew. Didn't know what to do as couldn't leave the car at the shop indefinitely. Happened to do a search (can't remember what I typed) on the internet and found damagedcars.com. Clicked on get offer and put the car info, and it redirected to carbrain.com. I liked that it gave me an offer immediately without asking for my personal info. I got a chat from Nancy but wasn't ready yet to accept the offer. The next day talked to Nancy and asked if I can get more for the car. She was able to increase the offer and I accepted. In a few hours she has scheduled the tow. On the day of the tow, waited at the auto shop for the tow truck. I then realized we didn't remove the 6 CDs in the car and the battery is dead. Called Nancy and asked if it's possible for them to send the CDs to me, even if I have to pay for the shipping. She said she will request it. When the tow truck came, the driver had a blank check as he didn't read the instructions on the offer, so started filling out the check there. I gave the check a once over and seems all is good, and he left with the car. Went to the bank and while waiting for my turn, I noticed that the check requires 2 signatures if more than $1000. Called Nancy and told her the check is not valid as only 1 signature was present. She called the tow truck driver but he said he wouldn't be able to turn around. Nancy called the company that issued the check. The guy wanted me to send back the check and then he will send a new one. I told Nancy no, they need to send me a check asap. Nancy told the guy to do a stop payment on the check, and carbrain will send me a check and the guy can reimburse carbrain. Nancy said the check will be fedexed overnight so I should get it the next day. The next day I texted her but didn't hear back. Called her and no one answered, so was getting worried. Then I sent her an email, and finally, somebody returned my call. Turns out Nancy was off that day but she left instructions with accounting to overnight the check. So I did get the check the next day (whew!). I was so thankful that I worked with Nancy. She was very nice and very helpful with resolving the issue with the check. And she went above and beyond by getting the CDs returned to me. I received them a week or so later. I have recommended carbrain to everyone I know. So fast and easy to sell a damaged car!",16 octobre 2017,5
"They were super easy to work with, I think it only took 3 days from the time we requested a quote until they picked up the car.   I didn't have the hassle of trying to sell the car myself and the price the quoted was very fair. I have been recommending them to my friends and family.",16 octobre 2017,5
Katie was great!Very prompt and professional service!,16 octobre 2017,5
"I worked with Delilah and she was great throughout the whole experience.  I got rid of my Subaru WRX after the engine crapped out on me.  It was a decent price considering it has a damaged engine and that it was pretty much hassle free to get my car picked up via tow and handed a check in the amount we agreed upon.  They even went through the trouble of coordinating with the car yard to try and look through the car to find something I may have left.  Very courteous, professional, and friendly.",13 octobre 2017,5
"Everything went smoothly.  CarBrain reps contacted me quickly and kept me abreast of most of the process.Good: They did an eval on the car which was okay, given the circumstances.  The reps were very good in communicating and allowing some extra time for me to get the title.  They were very flexibleCould use some work: Since the process is different for each state, the directions weren't clear which required a couple of unnecessary cycles.  Also the tow operator gave a 4 hour window for pickup. Of course it was well over 5 hours.",12 octobre 2017,5
"CarBrain was recommended by a friend, and I have since thanked him.  It was a great experience!  First class operation!  Katie Jones was professional and extremely helpful.  No issues whatsoever.

"I was already in a stressful situation, having had been in a car accident only days before being laid off. Selling my car could've added to the stress, but instead it couldn't have been easier. Nancy answered all the questions I had in a timely manner and I felt I was getting the best deal after looking at a few other places. Once I accepted the offer, my car was picked up 2 days later and I had my check. Thank you for helping out our family.",03 octobre 2017,5
Very helpful. Always available.,02 octobre 2017,5
"I admit I was a bit skeptical about selling my car through a website that I'd never heard of, but after going through the process, I was relieved to see that it all worked as advertised. Although the over-the-phone offer for my car ended up being about 80% of their initial automated estimate, I was still ultimately able to get more money for my car than any dealership was wanting to offer as a trade-in. I didn't have to work hard to sell my car to someone since all they needed was the info and then THEY told me what they would pay. Lastly, the process took me less than 24 hours from start to finish, ending with a check in my hand and the title in the hand of the guy about to tow my dead car away. Overall, I was satisfied with the experience and Delilah from Carbrain was great to work with.",02 octobre 2017,5

"I was told the man picking up my car would arrive in 45 minutes and then he never showed. I waited around all day and then I decided to call about 2 hours after he didn't show up on the time specified. I was told that he would arrive in 2 hours and the people had to track down a driver that could come to my house but then the driver had to come at 630pm after I got home because he didn't arrive during the time originally given and I had already waited around all day. I was thankful that someone came and picked up the car after office hours but that never should have happened. I only got $270 for a car that was in a lot better shape than that amount of money but I understood I was trying to just get the car out of my hands, so I wasn't pleased that for such a small amount of money, I had to track people down and wait around all day and move my schedule again to accommodate the company.",02 septembre 2017,3
"I had a 2006 Volvo S-40 w/ a burned out engine.  I needed the car removed from the mechanic's lot asap.  While at the office, I googled ""wrecked cars"".  CarBrain was first on the list. Within 10 minutes I had a confirmed offer on the vehicle and a confirmed date/time for pickup.  The transaction at the point of pick-up (i.e., exchange of signed title & check for the vehicle) took another 10 minutes.  Honestly.  20 minutes and $$ in my pocket!!! Wow!!  That's a 5-star rating!",30 ao√ªt 2017,5

I was in a situation where my Lexus Hybrid needed repairs amounting to the trade-in value of the car. I was offered only enough to pay the towing bill by local salvage yards. I found Carbrains.com and received a more than generous offer that I accepted and was able to move on to a new car and am very happy with the process,22 ao√ªt 2017,5

"Nancy was great.  The offer was fair.  Once I accepted the offer I had my check the next day.  The only downside was that the towing company was supposed to call me the next day to arrange a time to pick up my car.   Instead, they showed up that evening while I was working with a customer which was extremely inconvenient.  There needs to be better communication between CarBrain and their towing service.  If it wasn't for that I would give 5 stars.",22 ao√ªt 2017,5

"The entire Process was pretty seamless.  I had my car breakdown and it needed a new engine.  The cost of the new engine was more than what the car was valued at.  I found Carbrain with a simple Google search, and was skeptical.  They offered me more money for my vehicle than anyone else that I spoke with; they even offered to tow away my vehicle at their expense.The only hiccup that I experienced (hence the 4 star rating) was coordination on pickup time with the tow truck.  I work 10 minutes away from the location my vehicle was at, and the tow truck driver didn't call ahead like he was supposed to.  The intent of this call was to allow me time to leave work and meet him to give him the title and keys. In the end the driver was very apologetic and it really did not amount to much frustration on my end, but I wanted to at least clarify why I gave 4 stars.I certainly hope that I never have a junk car again, but if I do I would definitely use these guys again.  I would also recommend them to anyone else.",08 ao√ªt 2017,5
