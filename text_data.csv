Towing & title transfer are not free as quoted.,"I was definitely impressed comparatively speaking to the other companies that are out there with their professionalism. However, the fact that they tout that they offer free towing as well as title transfer as a bargaining tool when I wanted more for my car than they were asking by only $140.  The towing wasn't free and neither was the title transfer as was listed on the check that I received when they picked up my car, albeit in a timely manner.  It clearly states a total of $575 - $125 for the car removal and then $90 for the title. How is this free? I feel like they misrepresented that and for this I would never use them again. Don't say it's free if it's not. If they had told me out right the reality of it all I probably would have delivered the car myself because it was drivable. Their communication was excellent right up until the moment when they knew that they had the car and it had been taken away.  I haven't heard from anybody since even though I reached out.

Stress-free way to sell a car on Planned Non-Operation!,"CarBrain was surprisingly lovely to deal with, especially as a femme who doesn't know much about cars!Josue was my file manager and he was persistent, patient, and kind. He made it very easy for me to just text him the details about my car, and gave me a pretty decent offer ($595, which was $50 higher than the instant offer I got from Peddle). I appreciated how he reached out by both email and text message, and was completely in sync with whatever I'd put into the website.I could certainly have made more money by selling the car privately, but I didn't want to deal with all that would have involved, since my car was on Planned Non-Operation for 4 years.They paid me via Cash app and also offered Venmo. It took a bit longer than I expected to have the company come to pick it up, but everything went smoothly and the pick up person was also very kind (especially about me becoming emotional saying goodbye to my trusty old friend).Only things I'd say to consider:- Check online to see how long your offer is good for, because when I looked online it was good for a couple days longer than I'd been told verbally.- CarBrain has a car marketplace if you want to go through CarBrain but sell for a higher price than their offer. If I'd known that earlier, I probably would have wanted to do that (seems easier than selling via eBay / FB Marketplace / etc).- I had some technical glitches with the website, where it wouldn't let me enter a confirmation code. Hopefully they'll fix that, but the customer service was so excellent that it didn't impede me too much.",Date de l'exp√©rience:19 mars 2024,Not√© 5 sur 5 √©toiles

Great Experience,"Difficulty coordinating with the car towing outfit sent to pick up car.  Carbrain took care of it.

They also provided the free towing service for my car, and it was parked on the side of the driveway.

No, sorry, my car didn't lose 20% of its value in 24 hours, and also, you had an agreement with me, so stick with it.Bottom line: they didn't honor the offer they gave me and then lied to me when I confronted them about it.

I had mine fixed not long ago and from what I understand, it was welded but my mechanic never stated they changed it entirely or used an aftermarket part.

Smooth process,"I have never junked a car before and was nervous about finding an honest company.  Several of the most popular and frequently used auto recyclers in my area have numerous bad reviews (in excess of 50 within the last 3 months both online and through the BBB).  The complaints were always the same:1)	Tow company not showing up at the stated time.2)	Lowballing the offer.3)	Paying much less than the agreed upon offer even though the car was in the condition the owner stated at the time of the quote.4)	Handing out bad checks.One of the companies actually called me after I submitted my request and stated my vehicle had a lien so they were reducing the price by $300.  I have a clean title; I paid off the car 3 years ago.  The title is clean.  They re-entered my VIN and continued to claim it was showing a lien.  Obviously, this was not true.The other company was going to give me $50 more than Car Brain, but I had to find and contact the tow company myself and arrange for the pick-up (My undrivable car was at the repair shop.)  This company did not find a lien on my vehicle.  Then a little while later they sent a second offer via email with a lower offer.Once I submitted my info to Car Brain, I got an immediate response via email.  I went with Car Brain for one reason:  EDDISON!  He was terrific!  He fully explained their process and to ease my discomfort with junking my car, he offered to contact the tow company himself and make all of the arrangements for them to pick it up at the repair shop.  All I had to do was sign the title and send him a photo of it.  I then took the title to the repair shop and told them the amount of the check I was to receive.  The tow company arrived at exactly the time they promised, the check was for the full amount, and it cleared.  What a relief.There is no way this would have gone so smoothly without Eddison.  He was in constant contact with me via phone and text.  Despite my many concerns Eddison was honest, caring, and very patient.  I highly recommend Car Brain and urge you to request Eddison personally.

I got 370.00 which is a rip off, the company they use out of Orlando is the worst. They send a Spanish speaking man, I don't speak Spanish. They loaded my car and he gives me 380 and takes off before you can count the money. Call the tow company and they say the cadalic converter was missing, which it wasn't, and a lot of damage underneath, which wasn't the truth, I asked them to bring my car back and I'd return the money cause they ripped me off, so when a car brain Representative from car brain called I told them I didn't get what I was told was what the car was worth. He told me there investigating the tow company now cause I guess the company has gotten 3 other people saying they got ripped off by the tow company too, well in the mean time me and my family is out 190.00, All carbrain can say is were sorry and there investigating the tow company.But want me to give carbrain another chance. I don't think I'll trust them again. And it's too bad cause I now have another vehicle that isn't working and needs to be towed, but I can't trust this company. If carbrain would have said we're sorry and let us give you the 190.00 you lost, then we'll just sue the tow company to get are money back, but nothing but I'm sorry and give us another try.

"Positive experience, would recommend","I was selling an operating car with damage to the rear driver-side fender and back light. The cost of repairs exceeded the Blue Book value of the car, but the car was drivable and in good condition otherwise, with 111,000 miles on it.I tried several web sites and got bids ranging from $700 to $1,250.I was skeptical because nobody asked me to provide pictures of the damage and because I had a Texas title but the car was registered in Nevada. I did not want to be in a situation where the deal would be retraded at pick up time.I told Kevin that I wanted to send pictures of the car so he could see before we sealed the deal. He gave me clear instructions about what pictures to send, and confirmed that as long as I had clear title to the car, the origin of the title did not matter.After I had sent the pictures, Kevin increased his bid by about $200 and I accepted.The car was picked up within 2 days by a local company that delivered a check for the amount agreed upon in exchange for the car, the title and the keys.The entire process took a week.To recap, Kevin made it easy for me, answered all my questions, execution went according to the agreed upon terms, on a timely basis, with no negative surprises.

Very easy to do,"The process with Edison was very good. I didn't have the physical title, and he continued to follow up with me to ensure a smooth process. Once I completed the full paperwork process with the title, that is when things took a turn for not such a good turn.The pick-up was quick. The driver called and informed me that he was 25 minutes away. Once arrived I provided him with all information, however, I was surprised that he did not ask me for proof of ID. It wasn't a concern, but then it dawned on me that someone could sell a car and as long as the title is signed the car could be picked up without the true owner being aware that it was sold. Once I received the check, I contacted Bank of America to verify the funds. The business account listed on the check; the automatic system stated that the account number could not be found. I made the driver of the tow truck aware, and he contacted Angela in the local office (Jax, FL). I was able to conference her on the line to hear what Bank of America states about the checking account number. She stated that she doesn't know why it would say such a thing since her payroll is drawn from the same checking account and if it was any issues with her pay, she wouldn't be working there. Once I went into the house, unaware of the driver my office faces the street that the vehicle pick-up was taken on. I believe that Angela gave him a call back, and unknown to him my home cameras captured the audio of the conversation on his end. Not pleased and would rather not repeat the captured audio. However, I would say this. Just as anyone would do, I wanted to verify the legitimacy of the check. That is not something to make fun of or mock. It was poor customer service, and maybe the driver and Angela should express a bit of empathy when dealing with customers versus mocking anyone or you can leave the mocking for in-person conversations to prevent being captured on Camera audio and visual.I spoke with my bank and they assured me that if anything is captured with the check that is provided that they will notify me of the return. I was left with an uneasy feeling about selling my vehicle and provided a check with an account number that the bank validation line doesn't recognize.If it is any issues with the check, I will update the review page and inform viewers.

Fast & Easy,"First of all this whole process was foreign to me. I had never had to sell a car like this before. Mine was wrecked and totaled. The Car Brain team from the original starting rep getting all my information about my car to person that actually helps facilitate the buying was really good. My Rep Orlin was a great help to to me and stayed in good contact throughout.The only issue I have with the process is that they rely on IAA (Insurance Auto Auctions) all around the states to help coordinate the car pick up and tow. This is where the process may break down for you depending on how on the ball your local IAA business is. These tow truck drivers are individual contractors and make their own hours and are not entirely beholden to the IAA or your schedule even though they give you a time window for pick up. My window was not met and it was a pretty decent inconvenience for me since I had already planned it during my work day so when they told me the pick was actually not happening until the next day I was not a happy camper.

It was very easy to use Car Brain from‚Ä¶,"I found CarBrain online and was hesitant to use an out-of-state company until I read several reviews. Once I contacted them, Mr. Mendez shot me a quote same day. I wanted to shop around some local scrap yards for pricing and it took a few days to get quotes back that did not come close to CarBrain's price. Once I agreed to CarBrain's quote, they sent me a name & number for a local company to pick up my car and they ended up contacting me first. They wanted to come the next day but our schedules did not accommodate that time slot and we agreed on a few days later. The local company called ahead, the tow driver had the paperwork and cash as agreed. We produced our own bill of sale which the driver signed for us before releasing the car. The process took no more than 10 minutes - cash in hand/car gone...

It did take an extra day for them to get the tow company out to get my car - but that was a different company that seemed less efficient - but still completed the job.  My one complaint is that no-one mentioned anything about the License plate. It stayed on the car - but Im not sure if I was supposed to take it or tell the DMV that its no longer my plate?  They could have helped with that.  I have parking linked to that plate that I needed to cancel too.  Just an update: I called about the license plate and they mailed it back to me.

Happy CarBrain Customer,"CarBrain came to my rescue recently during a very stressful time. My well maintained and reliable SUV had engine failure unexpectedly on a hot day when my child and two dogs were with me. That was Sunday, and on Monday I found out about CarBrain and immediately contacted them about purchasing my car. John was very quick to respond to my inquiry, and he patiently answered all of my questions and eased my mind about which next steps I should take. On Wednesday afternoon, I reached out again to John and said that I was ready to accept their offer and proceed with the sale. On Friday afternoon, the tow truck for CarBrain arrived at my mechanic at my scheduled appointment time so I never had to wait. The driver was very courteous and efficient. I gave him the key to my car and the title in exchange for a check for the agreed upon price. That was it! From start to finish my experience with them was fair and hassle free.

The process was quick and easy,"My 93 Honda was my first vehicle and before that was my dad‚Äôs car since 93. I learned how to drive in it, and learned about the road. There was a lot wrong with mind and I knew that, I didn‚Äôt know how bad it was but it still kept chugging along. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I messed up a lot on it myself, but it kept going‚Ä¶ but it being an old vehicle meant not only was more coming apart, it‚Äôs parts were getting harder to find and expensive, plus things with me were also making things worse. Then the engine no longer worked, I figured I‚Äôd replace it, but there were still cost after that so I decided to sell it.The came the biggest problem, selling a car that doesn‚Äôt start. I wouldn‚Äôt get much for it outright, then how would I get it there? I DuckDuckGo places and I tried a few places, then came CarBrain. I was attracted to them because not only did they advertise for cars that didn‚Äôt start, THEY offered to pick it up. I was a little greedy at first the offered 400 at first and I wanted to hold out for at least 525. You gamble sometimes and win, others you lose, but even then, I ended up selling at 200, yet they still let me repost and try to get higher. I didn‚Äôt lose the one buyer and they let me try for more, no one bite (this time 425) and let me take the 200 offer after days of trying. Everything went quick afterwards, that day the towing company they partnered with was on the phone with me and I got it towed the next day. Got the money right as I handed the title, they even went out of there way to help with my last mistake‚Ä¶ I left my plate on. When I couldn‚Äôt reach the person who was towing it, I called CarBrain and they followed up and spoke to the towing company and arranged to get my license plate back, got it back that day.The only two mistakes were on my part (trying to go for more and forgetting my plate) but they were patient and worked with me on both.

Easy process and would recommend!,"I had a 2007 Acura TL with almost 205,000 miles; the body was straight, paint was in good shape and it had just a scratch on the rear side.  Mechanically, the car was drivable but had some issues.Although I was hesitant to use CarBrain I felt it didn't hurt to see what they had to offer, especially after reading their testimonials, which showed vehicles in far worse shape than mine was in and the former owners receiving, supposedly, $850 to $1200 and more, not to mention, I assumed that Acuras were more highly valued.After it was all said and done, I agreed to their offer of $255.  Yep, $255.  To be honest, I no longer had any use for the car and couldn't wait to remove it from my driveway and delete it from my insurance policy.I can only attribute their lowball offer to my car's relatively high mileage, but I only have myself to blame, for falling for CarBrain's slick advertising and selective testimonials (assuming the testimonials are real and not fake).To their credit, I will say that the communication between us was excellent, and they let me know of the status of my transaction all the way.There is certainly a value for such a company as CarBrain, and I would not rule out using them again.  My anticipation vs. actual outcome in my first transaction was not what I expected.  Sure, no one forced me to sell my car to CarBrain, and certainly I over-expected, but it was a bit disappointing.",Date de l'exp√©rience:09 septembre 2021,Not√© 5 sur 5 √©toiles

So I waited until 5:20 still heard nothing so I called back I was told that they will be picking it up the next day between 10:00 and 2:00 and I told them that I could not take off from work again and that the earliest I could be there was 4:00 and when I got there at 3:50 the car was gone!!! And I still had the title and they had my check. So I called them and they said that yes they picked up the car and I asked about the check and they said that they will try and get the driver to meet me to give me the check and I can give them the title.

I found CarBrain online and within 24 hours they came back with a $6000 offer. I countered with $6500 and they accepted. We sent the requested photos, title etc. We actually found the second remote key fob and I countered again with photos of them as they are worth a couple hundred each and they gave us another $250! They came to the dealership, where we left the vehicle, with a tow truck and handed us a check for $6750, which cleared the next day!

The driver never called (apparently he didn't speak much English). The service dept. knew the car was being towed, so when he arrived, they let him take it. I called the dispatch to find out when they were going to pick up the car & was told it had already been picked up.

This was the easiest way for me to sell‚Ä¶,My experience with CarBrain was excellent.  I got a great offer for my vehicle.  When i decided to take the offer I was given clear instructions on how to proceed that were simple and easy to follow. The local company that handled the pickup with me kinda got wires crossed but 1 call to carbrain and it was taken care of.  Tow truck driver came on schedule got the title annd key and handed over my check.  It was much easier and quicker than i expected it to be.  From the first contact I made until I had my check was 4 days and it was only that long because I called on a Friday afternoon.  Excellent job from start to finish.

My car was located at my brothers‚Ä¶,"My car was located at my brothers cottage over an hour north of my home, So I wasn't able to schedule a weekday pickup. Yet the company assigned to pick up my car kept calling saying we are in your area (the car location) we can pick up the car. # times this happened each time I explained that the car was an hour away from my current location. So I took a friday off from work for the arranged pickup. A 9 to noon window was arranged.  Noon came and went no truck had come, so I call the number I had to contact the driver. The number was to the companies dispatch, they said that they would contact the driver and put me on hold, and I lost the cell signal or they cut me off. I called again, same as before and I lost the signal, or? I then call Car brain they said that they would contact the company and get back to me, they did not. I called Car brain again the agent said that they would contact the pickup company while I held. They came back on the line and said that the pickup company wasn't able to make the pickup that day, but could on tuesday. I informed them that I did not live at the location of the car and I would be an hour south on tuesday. To which they offer a unattended pickup (I leave the signed title and keys in the car and they would pickup the car and mail me the check in 7 to 10 business days.) I told them I would leave keys and when I received the check I would send them the title. They responded that they don't work that way. And I made a comment that I saw how they work and If that wouldn't work for them that I couldn't complete the transaction. I  relayed all this information to Car brain, to which they responded that was how their pickup company wished to deal with their customers. I left for home after this back and forth.

My vehicle was picked up within a few days of agreeing to their quoted buying price, and a check was written to me for that amount at the time of vehicle removal.

You must also take into account any other fees and DMV paperwork that you must file if selling it privately; CarBrain takes care of it for you.  The amount offered is fair, and in my case, worth it.

Good communication and easy transaction,"Predatory company, especially with COVID-19. Felt like they were praying upon my situation hoping I would be desperate. Go with Peddle, way better experience.So, I entered my VIN and stuff but did not have any pics at the time and was going to put them in the next day. It said based on everything I would be offered $4390-$2500 and would need pics for more value.Before I could submit pics they already sent me an offer for $2250 later that next day. I emailed Angela (very unprofessional, never answers direct questions and replies with generic responses) sent her the pics and everything. My car had nothing but an engine problem; the exterior and interior was pristine. I told her I was expecting to get closer to the 4 range for my Mercedes. She replied and said she would update my file and shop with buyers. A few hours later, CONGRATS you have an offer for $2250. I was like so you are giving me the same exact price as the one with no pictures. She replied with a generic response and said that was all that the buyers could do basically.  I knew what my vehicle was worth and even if you wanted to part the thing out. It made no sense. Either she didn‚Äôt want to update the offer or her manager is praying upon my situation from the email I sent.Anyways I got $1800 more on peddle and they are very thorough with the details you enter before they even give you an instant offer. And you have the option to list it.I never review companies but I really felt the need to because I don‚Äôt want people getting screwed. Would never recommend this company and will always recommend Peddle.Reply to Carbrain:I have not used any negative language other than the fact my experience with you all has been negative. And please quit calling my number and trying to contact me. I have no more business with you all other than the your low ball offer that I respectfully declined/questioned.  You should just accept the negative review and get better at being fair. And I would be happy to post all the conversations I‚Äôve had. But there‚Äôs no need I explained it thoroughly and honestly enough.My advice to others: read what the low reviews say because they are all very similar to my experience because I feel like they pump up their 5-star reviews on this site just like an amazon product.",Date de l'exp√©rience:27 juillet 2020,Not√© 4 sur 5 √©toiles

CarBrain is high buying value,"It was a very simple process and I was fairly happy with CarBrain's service. The actual pickup was weird though. The driver was supposed to call me when he was on his way so that I could meet him at the mechanic's shop. Instead, he went ahead and just picked up the car on his own and only called me when he was heading out of town because he wanted to get my other key. I had to drive across town to meet him and get my check but no one had communicated the agreed-upon price to him. I had to tell him the amount and he acted really annoyed as he wrote it out. I'd probably use CarBrain again because they do make it an easy process (and offered a fair price), but beware that there can be problems depending on the area towing company that they use.",Date de l'exp√©rience:17 juillet 2020,Not√© 5 sur 5 √©toiles

CarBrain is legit.,"My car physically looked in top shape but the engine was shutting on and off. For that, I wanted to get a fair price when I decided to sell. I was extremely wary to use a faceless app but I wanted to sell quickly and took a chance. If you're in the same boat, DON'T HESITATE. After looking up the company up on BBB and reading as much reviews as I could find, I took a chance. Well, CarBrain is legit and I had a seamless experience. I snapped photos of the interior and exterior of my car and sent them over to a sales associate. She came back with a quote that I wasn't quite happy with and they renegotiated with a slightly higher price. After locking in that deal, they gave me instructions to get the title ready for transfer. A tow truck company then contacted me the next day to arrange a pick up time. Two days later, the tow truck driver handed me a check in exchange for my title and keys. I cashed my check that same day.

After I accepted my offer I was sent an email that specifically stated the tow company would be contacting me. When this never happened i called carbrain and they told me that the company would not call me, I had to call them. I explained to them that it specifically states on their email that the tow company will contact you, why include that if its not true? Fast forward to two failed attempts at getting the car towed and multiple messages left on various answering machines of various tow companies and this whole experience was a giant flop. Add to that the fact that I had to ask 3 elderly people to have their cars moved because i was waiting for a tow truck that never came. I was finally told the tow company rescheduled without telling me after wasting an ENTIRE day. After weeks of this, I cancelled my lowball offer from carbrain and went ahead with donating my car.

I asked a lot of questions and was communicated with via text and it was so smooth. The process itself took maybe a week if not less. I didn‚Äôt even have to be in Orlando for them to pick it up.

They responded on Monday and asked me to send some info on the vehicle, as well as a few photos. They said they would check with their partners in my area and make an offer. By Wednesday  I had an offer which was for much more than I thought I'd get.  I accepted and they sent me the contact info. I set up the pickup for Thursday and the tow driver arrived on time with a check for the agreed upon amount. I signed over the title and deposited the check on Friday.

Remote sale of vehicle,"My cars' engine died 6 hours away from home while my son was visiting friends.  We decided it was too expensive to repair and only had a few days to find a way to dispose of it and get some money back.  Trying to do this remotely is not easy.  We found CarBrain on the internet, completed the online information and received a quote.  After a few phone calls to CarBrain and other businesses we decided to go with CarBrain.  They were offering the most and many of the other places required you to be present or have the car towed to their facility for an appraisal.  They arranged for the car to be towed to auction, sent a Fedex label for us to send the title and a few days later we had a check.  It all went as explained to us and we were able to call and text our contact at CarBrain whenever we had questions.

Everything went pretty smoothly.,"I have never had an experience like this ever before. CarBrain and its partner in Los Angeles AA Import promised to purchase my care for $350. They promised the purchase would be completed within two days. I agreed to offer on 5/31 and they didn't schedule pick-up until 6/4. 15 minutes before we were supposed to meet, AA Import sent me a text and said they weren't paying the $350 we had been discussing for several days and they only were going to pay $250. CarBrain said they couldn't do that, etc, etc. I waited for hours to hear back as to when they would pick up my car and they never did. So after almost a week of stringing me along the only thing that CarBrain did for me was rack up a storage bill of $400.

ahmad,"Amazing. Original estimated offer was 1650 on a 2008 rav4 with a blown transmission. I called the next day and sent pictures of the vehicle. Within a couple hours they got back to me with an official offer of 1620, and we scheduled the pickup for the next morning. The guy showed up during the time frame they gave me and gave me a call an hour ahead of time. He had the check with him. I was very skeptical about carbrain, but they helped me big time. I got an appraisal on my car for 1200 at a carmax, and because of car brain I was able to put a bigger down payment down on a new car.

Selling made easy.,I am writing this review to make people aware that when you receive the check from the local agent (copart) that picks up your car and title you will not be able to cash it right away as you will be mislead into believing. You will have to hold the check at least 24 business hours to cash it. I went to the bank that the check was written on and there system told them to return the check to copart. After speaking to the manager I was able to keep the check because she had witness this before. When I called copart the lady I spoke to seemed to be bothered by my call. I have still not been able to cash the check but on Monday I will try again.

All of my contacts with car brain were‚Ä¶,"All of my contacts with car brain were awesome but unfortunately Carport who picked up my car sucked. Big time sucked.They never called to let me know they were coming, when I called to follow up since I had to have somebody meet them, and the window in which they were supposed to arrive was rapidly closing.... Her attitude was extremely laid back and she said yeah they're the gonna be there yeah they'll call.  Well they didn't call, and they took the car before they got the title which means I received no check and they took the car with my prescription sunglasses still in it.  If they would have called I would have had someone meet them get my sunglasses out of the car handed them the title and get my check. I called car brain told them where in the car the title was. I was assured by car brain that the next morning they would be dropping off my glasses and my check. I left instructions were to leave these items. All they left were my sunglasses because they didn't have the title because nobody passed the message on. Then I get a call from Carport basically giving me the riot act for not having a title. They're the ones that pretty much stole my car!He was threatening me. I finally  stated if his people had done what I asked and what they told me they were going to do none of this would have happened and it was on him and his staff.So Carbrain rocked.

I will caution though, the towing company who came didn't know how much to write the check out for, so I had to show him the email for confirmation. Initially, when I gave him the keys, he said thanks as if he had no intention of paying me, so I found that a bit odd. All in all, this was a great and seamless experience for me.

Great experience,"I NEVER write a review for anything to me it‚Äôs a waste of time; however, I had such a bad experience with car brain that if this review helps even one person stay away from this company then it‚Äôs worth my time.I went through the long process of getting a quote for me car. I received a quote for $900 for my 2003 Mazda 6 (good condition everything works ). Fine, I waited a few days later for someone from car brain to call me and say ‚Äú we had a computer glitch and the offer you got of $900 was an computer error! ‚Äú and she went on to say they can‚Äôt find any buyers in my area for my car.This was obviously a flat out lie. Plus I live in NYC and a Mazda 6 is a popular car! AVOID THIS COMPANY THEY ARE LIARS!!! They will waste your time. Call your local junk yards instead.

Ez to do and pleasent to.work with.,"Started out a good, quick experience.  Set up to pick up the car the next morning.  When no one contacted me about the pickup I was told it would be sometime next week.  I explained this was unacceptable and set up a pickup for the next day.  Next day, no pickup.  When I called I was told that it wouldn't be until sometime next week.  I called carbrain and they said that they couldn't/wouldn't make any other arrangements.  I told them they obviously didn't want my business and I would find someone else who was more reliable.UPDATE:  After posting this review I received a call from the COO of Carbrain who said they would make this right and schedule a pickup on Tuesday morning (Monday was a holiday).  I agreed to give them another chance.  Fast forward to Tuesday morning.  I receive a call from a nice young lady who said she was going to schedule a pickup sometime this week.  I told her this was unacceptable and that I needed it picked up today.  She said she couldn't schedule ""same day"" pickup.  I explained in no uncertain terms that this was NOT a same day pickup, that it has been almost a week.  She said there was nothing she could do.  In short, this has gone from good to bad to good to bad.UPDATE 2  Carbrain's COO again reached out to me to try to make things right.  He was most kind and seemed like he wanted to do right by me.  I had by this time however, made other arrangements for the car.  Although we couldn't do business this time, I do appreciate his efforts and am impressed at how quickly he responds to customer issues.  Maybe next time.",Date de l'exp√©rience:01 juin 2018,Not√© 5 sur 5 √©toiles

The communication with the agent was ‚Ä¶,"Our car died while driving on the highway and had to have it towed to a local shop. Turns out the engine blew. Didn't know what to do as couldn't leave the car at the shop indefinitely. Happened to do a search (can't remember what I typed) on the internet and found damagedcars.com. Clicked on get offer and put the car info, and it redirected to carbrain.com. I liked that it gave me an offer immediately without asking for my personal info. I got a chat from Nancy but wasn't ready yet to accept the offer. The next day talked to Nancy and asked if I can get more for the car. She was able to increase the offer and I accepted. In a few hours she has scheduled the tow. On the day of the tow, waited at the auto shop for the tow truck. I then realized we didn't remove the 6 CDs in the car and the battery is dead. Called Nancy and asked if it's possible for them to send the CDs to me, even if I have to pay for the shipping. She said she will request it. When the tow truck came, the driver had a blank check as he didn't read the instructions on the offer, so started filling out the check there. I gave the check a once over and seems all is good, and he left with the car. Went to the bank and while waiting for my turn, I noticed that the check requires 2 signatures if more than $1000. Called Nancy and told her the check is not valid as only 1 signature was present. She called the tow truck driver but he said he wouldn't be able to turn around. Nancy called the company that issued the check. The guy wanted me to send back the check and then he will send a new one. I told Nancy no, they need to send me a check asap. Nancy told the guy to do a stop payment on the check, and carbrain will send me a check and the guy can reimburse carbrain. Nancy said the check will be fedexed overnight so I should get it the next day. The next day I texted her but didn't hear back. Called her and no one answered, so was getting worried. Then I sent her an email, and finally, somebody returned my call. Turns out Nancy was off that day but she left instructions with accounting to overnight the check. So I did get the check the next day (whew!). I was so thankful that I worked with Nancy. She was very nice and very helpful with resolving the issue with the check.

I admit I was a bit skeptical..,"I admit I was a bit skeptical about selling my car through a website that I'd never heard of, but after going through the process, I was relieved to see that it all worked as advertised. Although the over-the-phone offer for my car ended up being about 80% of their initial automated estimate, I was still ultimately able to get more money for my car than any dealership was wanting to offer as a trade-in. I didn't have to work hard to sell my car to someone since all they needed was the info and then THEY told me what they would pay. Lastly, the process took me less than 24 hours from start to finish, ending with a check in my hand and the title in the hand of the guy about to tow my dead car away.

Not So Pleased,"I was told the man picking up my car would arrive in 45 minutes and then he never showed. I waited around all day and then I decided to call about 2 hours after he didn't show up on the time specified. I was told that he would arrive in 2 hours and the people had to track down a driver that could come to my house but then the driver had to come at 630pm after I got home because he didn't arrive during the time originally given and I had already waited around all day. I was thankful that someone came and picked up the car after office hours but that never should have happened. I only got $270 for a car that was in a lot better shape than that amount of money but I understood I was trying to just get the car out of my hands, so I wasn't pleased that for such a small amount of money, I had to track people down and wait around all day and move my schedule again to accommodate the company.",Date de l'exp√©rience:02 septembre 2017,Not√© 3 sur 5 √©toiles

A great way to dispose of a damaged vehicle.,"The entire Process was pretty seamless.  I had my car breakdown and it needed a new engine.  The cost of the new engine was more than what the car was valued at.  I found Carbrain with a simple Google search, and was skeptical.  They offered me more money for my vehicle than anyone else that I spoke with; they even offered to tow away my vehicle at their expense.The only hiccup that I experienced (hence the 4 star rating) was coordination on pickup time with the tow truck.  I work 10 minutes away from the location my vehicle was at, and the tow truck driver didn't call ahead like he was supposed to.  The intent of this call was to allow me time to leave work and meet him to give him the title and keys. In the end the driver was very apologetic and it really did not amount to much frustration on my end, but I wanted to at least clarify why I gave 4 stars.I certainly hope that I never have a junk car again, but if I do I would definitely use these guys again.
