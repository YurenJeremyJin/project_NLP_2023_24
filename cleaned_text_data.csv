"I was definitely impressed comparatively speaking to the other companies that are out there with their professionalism. However, the fact that they tout that they offer free towing as well as title transfer as a bargaining tool when I wanted more for my car than they were asking by only $140.  The towing wasn't free and neither was the title transfer as was listed on the check that I received when they picked up my car, albeit in a timely manner.  It clearly states a total of $575 - $125 for the car removal and then $90 for the title. How is this free? I feel like they misrepresented that and for this I would never use them again. Don't say it's free if it's not. If they had told me out right the reality of it all I probably would have delivered the car myself because it was drivable. Their communication was excellent right up until the moment when they knew that they had the car and it had been taken away.  I haven't heard from anybody since even though I reached out. Christian, as great as he was failed to respond and follow up when I asked about the above stated issue.  Just like any salesperson he had what he needed.

"CarBrain was surprisingly lovely to deal with, especially as a femme who doesn't know much about cars!Josue was my file manager and he was persistent, patient, and kind. He made it very easy for me to just text him the details about my car, and gave me a pretty decent offer ($595, which was $50 higher than the instant offer I got from Peddle). I appreciated how he reached out by both email and text message, and was completely in sync with whatever I'd put into the website.I could certainly have made more money by selling the car privately, but I didn't want to deal with all that would have involved, since my car was on Planned Non-Operation for 4 years.They paid me via Cash app and also offered Venmo. It took a bit longer than I expected to have the company come to pick it up, but everything went smoothly and the pick up person was also very kind (especially about me becoming emotional saying goodbye to my trusty old friend).Only things I'd say to consider:- Check online to see how long your offer is good for, because when I looked online it was good for a couple days longer than I'd been told verbally.- CarBrain has a car marketplace if you want to go through CarBrain but sell for a higher price than their offer. If I'd known that earlier, I probably would have wanted to do that (seems easier than selling via eBay / FB Marketplace / etc).- I had some technical glitches with the website, where it wouldn't let me enter a confirmation code. Hopefully they'll fix that, but the customer service was so excellent that it didn't impede me too much.",19 mars 2024,5,carbrain surprisingly lovely deal especially femme know much car josue file manager persistent patient kind made easy text detail car gave pretty decent offer 595 50 higher instant offer got peddle appreciated reached email text message completely sync whatever put website could certainly made money selling car privately want deal would involved since car planned non operation 4 year paid via cash app also offered venmo took bit longer expected company come pick everything went smoothly pick person also kind especially becoming emotional saying goodbye trusty old friend thing say consider check online see long offer good looked online good couple day longer told verbally carbrain car marketplace want go carbrain sell higher price offer known earlier probably would wanted seems easier selling via ebay fb marketplace etc technical glitch website let enter confirmation code hopefully fix customer service excellent impede much

"CarBrain offered the highest amount for my 29 year old, non running car. It was hard to let my car go, since I had put a lot of love, and money into it over 25 years.

They also provided the free towing service for my car, and it was parked on the side of the driveway. The only reason that I cannot give a 5 Star rating, is because I had a lot of difficulty understanding some of the phone operators. Some of them had very strong accents, and seemed like they were in different countries. That was less than favorable.

I had mine fixed not long ago and from what I understand, it was welded but my mechanic never stated they changed it entirely or used an aftermarket part.

"I have never junked a car before and was nervous about finding an honest company.  Several of the most popular and frequently used auto recyclers in my area have numerous bad reviews (in excess of 50 within the last 3 months both online and through the BBB).  The complaints were always the same:1)	Tow company not showing up at the stated time.2)	Lowballing the offer.3)	Paying much less than the agreed upon offer even though the car was in the condition the owner stated at the time of the quote.4)	Handing out bad checks.One of the companies actually called me after I submitted my request and stated my vehicle had a lien so they were reducing the price by $300.  I have a clean title; I paid off the car 3 years ago.  The title is clean.  They re-entered my VIN and continued to claim it was showing a lien.  Obviously, this was not true.The other company was going to give me $50 more than Car Brain, but I had to find and contact the tow company myself and arrange for the pick-up (My undrivable car was at the repair shop.)  This company did not find a lien on my vehicle.  Then a little while later they sent a second offer via email with a lower offer.Once I submitted my info to Car Brain, I got an immediate response via email.  I went with Car Brain for one reason:  EDDISON!  He was terrific!  He fully explained their process and to ease my discomfort with junking my car, he offered to contact the tow company himself and make all of the arrangements for them to pick it up at the repair shop.  All I had to do was sign the title and send him a photo of it.  I then took the title to the repair shop and told them the amount of the check I was to receive.  The tow company arrived at exactly the time they promised, the check was for the full amount, and it cleared.  What a relief.There is no way this would have gone so smoothly without Eddison.  He was in constant contact with me via phone and text.  Despite my many concerns Eddison was honest, caring, and very patient.  I highly recommend Car Brain and urge you to request Eddison personally.

"I was selling an operating car with damage to the rear driver-side fender and back light. The cost of repairs exceeded the Blue Book value of the car, but the car was drivable and in good condition otherwise, with 111,000 miles on it.I tried several web sites and got bids ranging from $700 to $1,250.I was skeptical because nobody asked me to provide pictures of the damage and because I had a Texas title but the car was registered in Nevada. I did not want to be in a situation where the deal would be retraded at pick up time.I told Kevin that I wanted to send pictures of the car so he could see before we sealed the deal.

"The process with Edison was very good. I didn't have the physical title, and he continued to follow up with me to ensure a smooth process. Once I completed the full paperwork process with the title, that is when things took a turn for not such a good turn.The pick-up was quick. The driver called and informed me that he was 25 minutes away. Once arrived I provided him with all information, however, I was surprised that he did not ask me for proof of ID. It wasn't a concern, but then it dawned on me that someone could sell a car and as long as the title is signed the car could be picked up without the true owner being aware that it was sold. Once I received the check, I contacted Bank of America to verify the funds. The business account listed on the check; the automatic system stated that the account number could not be found. I made the driver of the tow truck aware, and he contacted Angela in the local office (Jax, FL). I was able to conference her on the line to hear what Bank of America states about the checking account number. She stated that she doesn't know why it would say such a thing since her payroll is drawn from the same checking account and if it was any issues with her pay, she wouldn't be working there. Once I went into the house, unaware of the driver my office faces the street that the vehicle pick-up was taken on. I believe that Angela gave him a call back, and unknown to him my home cameras captured the audio of the conversation on his end. Not pleased and would rather not repeat the captured audio. However, I would say this. Just as anyone would do, I wanted to verify the legitimacy of the check. That is not something to make fun of or mock. It was poor customer service, and maybe the driver and Angela should express a bit of empathy when dealing with customers versus mocking anyone or you can leave the mocking for in-person conversations to prevent being captured on Camera audio and visual.I spoke with my bank and they assured me that if anything is captured with the check that is provided that they will notify me of the return. I was left with an uneasy feeling about selling my vehicle and provided a check with an account number that the bank validation line doesn't recognize.If it is any issues with the check, I will update the review page and inform viewers. Lets truly hope that I am worked over nothing and that the local individuals here receive customer service training to some extent.",26 mai 2023,5,process edison good physical title continued follow ensure smooth process completed full paperwork process title thing took turn good turn pick quick driver called informed 25 minute away arrived provided information however surprised ask proof id concern dawned someone could sell car long title signed car could picked without true owner aware sold received check contacted bank america verify fund business account listed check automatic system stated account number could found made driver tow truck aware contacted angela local office jax fl able conference line hear bank america state checking account number stated know would say thing since payroll drawn checking account issue pay working went house unaware driver office face street vehicle pick taken believe angela gave call back unknown home camera captured audio conversation end pleased would rather repeat captured audio however would say anyone would wanted verify legitimacy check something make fun mock poor customer service maybe driver angela express bit empathy dealing customer versus mocking anyone leave mocking person conversation prevent captured camera audio visual spoke bank assured anything captured check provided notify return left uneasy feeling selling vehicle provided check account number bank validation line recognize issue check update review page inform viewer let truly hope worked nothing local individual receive customer service training extent

"First of all this whole process was foreign to me. I had never had to sell a car like this before. Mine was wrecked and totaled. The Car Brain team from the original starting rep getting all my information about my car to person that actually helps facilitate the buying was really good. My Rep Orlin was a great help to to me and stayed in good contact throughout.The only issue I have with the process is that they rely on IAA (Insurance Auto Auctions) all around the states to help coordinate the car pick up and tow. This is where the process may break down for you depending on how on the ball your local IAA business is. These tow truck drivers are individual contractors and make their own hours and are not entirely beholden to the IAA or your schedule even though they give you a time window for pick up. My window was not met and it was a pretty decent inconvenience for me since I had already planned it during my work day so when they told me the pick was actually not happening until the next day I was not a happy camper.  And when I called the IAA team the girl there was always frustrated that I was calling to check on things and I only called 3 times in two days which I thought was reasonable considering.However, once the towing company finally called me, way later then expected the next day, they were really nice and kept in contact with me from that point on. The pick up and trading of my paperwork for the check was very smooth. The final step will be to get a bill of sale from Car Brain so I can go to my local county clerks to make sure the car is no longer in my name.",07 avril 2023,5,first whole process foreign never sell car like mine wrecked totaled car brain team original starting rep getting information car person actually help facilitate buying really good rep orlin great help stayed good contact throughout issue process rely iaa insurance auto auction around state help coordinate car pick tow process may break depending ball local iaa business tow truck driver individual contractor make hour entirely beholden iaa schedule even though give time window pick window met pretty decent inconvenience since already planned work day told pick actually happening next day happy camper called iaa team girl always frustrated calling check thing called 3 time two day thought reasonable considering however towing company finally called way later expected next day really nice kept contact point pick trading paperwork check smooth final step get bill sale car brain go local county clerk make sure car longer name

It did take an extra day for them to get the tow company out to get my car - but that was a different company that seemed less efficient - but still completed the job.  My one complaint is that no-one mentioned anything about the License plate. It stayed on the car - but Im not sure if I was supposed to take it or tell the DMV that its no longer my plate?  They could have helped with that.  I have parking linked to that plate that I needed to cancel too.  Just an update: I called about the license plate and they mailed it back to me.

"My 93 Honda was my first vehicle and before that was my dad‚Äôs car since 93. I learned how to drive in it, and learned about the road. There was a lot wrong with mind and I knew that, I didn‚Äôt know how bad it was but it still kept chugging along. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I messed up a lot on it myself, but it kept going‚Ä¶ but it being an old vehicle meant not only was more coming apart, it‚Äôs parts were getting harder to find and expensive, plus things with me were also making things worse. Then the engine no longer worked, I figured I‚Äôd replace it, but there were still cost after that so I decided to sell it.The came the biggest problem, selling a car that doesn‚Äôt start. I wouldn‚Äôt get much for it outright, then how would I get it there? I DuckDuckGo places and I tried a few places, then came CarBrain. I was attracted to them because not only did they advertise for cars that didn‚Äôt start, THEY offered to pick it up. I was a little greedy at first the offered 400 at first and I wanted to hold out for at least 525. You gamble sometimes and win, others you lose, but even then, I ended up selling at 200, yet they still let me repost and try to get higher. I didn‚Äôt lose the one buyer and they let me try for more, no one bite (this time 425) and let me take the 200 offer after days of trying. Everything went quick afterwards, that day the towing company they partnered with was on the phone with me and I got it towed the next day. Got the money right as I handed the title, they even went out of there way to help with my last mistake‚Ä¶ I left my plate on. When I couldn‚Äôt reach the person who was towing it, I called CarBrain and they followed up and spoke to the towing company and arranged to get my license plate back, got it back that day.The only two mistakes were on my part (trying to go for more and forgetting my plate) but they were patient and worked with me on both. I always knew the last lesson my Honda would teach my was my parting with it, thanks to CarBrain, it went well.",06 mars 2022,5,93 honda first vehicle dad car since 93 learned drive learned road lot wrong mind knew know bad still kept chugging along going lie messed lot kept going old vehicle meant coming apart part getting harder find expensive plus thing also making thing worse engine longer worked figured replace still cost decided sell came biggest problem selling car start get much outright would get duckduckgo place tried place came carbrain attracted advertise car start offered pick little greedy first offered 400 first wanted hold least 525 gamble sometimes win others lose even ended selling 200 yet still let repost try get higher lose one buyer let try one bite time 425 let take 200 offer day trying everything went quick afterwards day towing company partnered phone got towed next day got money right handed title even went way help last mistake left plate reach person towing called carbrain followed spoke towing company arranged get license plate back got back day two mistake part trying go forgetting plate patient worked always knew last lesson honda would teach parting thanks carbrain went well

"I had a 2007 Acura TL with almost 205,000 miles; the body was straight, paint was in good shape and it had just a scratch on the rear side.  Mechanically, the car was drivable but had some issues.Although I was hesitant to use CarBrain I felt it didn't hurt to see what they had to offer, especially after reading their testimonials, which showed vehicles in far worse shape than mine was in and the former owners receiving, supposedly, $850 to $1200 and more, not to mention, I assumed that Acuras were more highly valued.After it was all said and done, I agreed to their offer of $255.  Yep, $255.  To be honest, I no longer had any use for the car and couldn't wait to remove it from my driveway and delete it from my insurance policy.I can only attribute their lowball offer to my car's relatively high mileage, but I only have myself to blame, for falling for CarBrain's slick advertising and selective testimonials (assuming the testimonials are real and not fake).To their credit, I will say that the communication between us was excellent, and they let me know of the status of my transaction all the way.There is certainly a value for such a company as CarBrain, and I would not rule out using them again.  My anticipation vs. actual outcome in my first transaction was not what I expected.  Sure, no one forced me to sell my car to CarBrain, and certainly I over-expected, but it was a bit disappointing.",09 septembre 2021,5,2007 acura tl almost 205 000 mile body straight paint good shape scratch rear side mechanically car drivable issue although hesitant use carbrain felt hurt see offer especially reading testimonial showed vehicle far worse shape mine former owner receiving supposedly 850 1200 mention assumed acuras highly valued said done agreed offer 255 yep 255 honest longer use car wait remove driveway delete insurance policy attribute lowball offer car relatively high mileage blame falling carbrain slick advertising selective testimonial assuming testimonial real fake credit say communication u excellent let know status transaction way certainly value company carbrain would rule using anticipation v actual outcome first transaction expected sure one forced sell car carbrain certainly expected bit disappointing

So I waited until 5:20 still heard nothing so I called back I was told that they will be picking it up the next day between 10:00 and 2:00 and I told them that I could not take off from work again and that the earliest I could be there was 4:00 and when I got there at 3:50 the car was gone!!! And I still had the title and they had my check. So I called them and they said that yes they picked up the car and I asked about the check and they said that they will try and get the driver to meet me to give me the check and I can give them the title.

I found CarBrain online and within 24 hours they came back with a $6000 offer. I countered with $6500 and they accepted. We sent the requested photos, title etc. We actually found the second remote key fob and I countered again with photos of them as they are worth a couple hundred each and they gave us another $250!

"The initial process went fine with receiving a fair offer for our vehicle. I called a few other junkyards and CarBrain offered a much better price & was willing to pick up a vehicle that didn't run for no charge.The only challenges we had were with the local tow company that came to pick up the vehicle. The tow driver was supposed to call me when he was on his way to the dealership (where the car was waiting) so I could meet him there. I had the title and he had the payment check. The driver never called (apparently he didn't speak much English). The service dept. knew the car was being towed, so when he arrived, they let him take it. I called the dispatch to find out when they were going to pick up the car & was told it had already been picked up. I still had the title, but not the car or the check, so it took a lot of back & forth and the driver eventually met me back at the dealership to finish the transaction. It ended up taking quite a bit longer than it should have.",24 octobre 2020,4,initial process went fine receiving fair offer vehicle called junkyard carbrain offered much better price willing pick vehicle run charge challenge local tow company came pick vehicle tow driver supposed call way dealership car waiting could meet title payment check driver never called apparently speak much english service dept knew car towed arrived let take called dispatch find going pick car told already picked still title car check took lot back forth driver eventually met back dealership finish transaction ended taking quite bit longer

"Predatory company, especially with COVID-19. Felt like they were praying upon my situation hoping I would be desperate. Go with Peddle, way better experience.So, I entered my VIN and stuff but did not have any pics at the time and was going to put them in the next day. It said based on everything I would be offered $4390-$2500 and would need pics for more value.Before I could submit pics they already sent me an offer for $2250 later that next day. I emailed Angela (very unprofessional, never answers direct questions and replies with generic responses) sent her the pics and everything. My car had nothing but an engine problem; the exterior and interior was pristine. I told her I was expecting to get closer to the 4 range for my Mercedes. She replied and said she would update my file and shop with buyers. A few hours later, CONGRATS you have an offer for $2250. I was like so you are giving me the same exact price as the one with no pictures. She replied with a generic response and said that was all that the buyers could do basically.  I knew what my vehicle was worth and even if you wanted to part the thing out. It made no sense. Either she didn‚Äôt want to update the offer or her manager is praying upon my situation from the email I sent.Anyways I got $1800 more on peddle and they are very thorough with the details you enter before they even give you an instant offer. And you have the option to list it.I never review companies but I really felt the need to because I don‚Äôt want people getting screwed. Would never recommend this company and will always recommend Peddle.Reply to Carbrain:I have not used any negative language other than the fact my experience with you all has been negative.

"My car physically looked in top shape but the engine was shutting on and off. For that, I wanted to get a fair price when I decided to sell.

After looking up the company up on BBB and reading as much reviews as I could find, I took a chance. Well, CarBrain is legit and I had a seamless experience. I snapped photos of the interior and exterior of my car and sent them over to a sales associate. She came back with a quote that I wasn't quite happy with and they renegotiated with a slightly higher price. After locking in that deal, they gave me instructions to get the title ready for transfer. A tow truck company then contacted me the next day to arrange a pick up time. Two days later, the tow truck driver handed me a check in exchange for my title and keys. I cashed my check that same day.

"To be honest I, like many others was very skeptical about this. I have a 2009 VW Tiguan, the engine had died and it was sitting in a repair shop in Orlando while I was in Jacksonville. I asked the repair shop if they could it sell it they said I‚Äôd maybe get $200 dollars. Which was nothing because the car was in excellent condition it just unfortunately no longer had a working engine. I took the risk and got a quote from carbrain and they offered me $750. Which was way higher than the repair shops offer. I went ahead and went through with it, took photos of my car. Took photos of the vin, and went ahead with the process. I asked a lot of questions and was communicated with via text and it was so smooth. The process itself took maybe a week if not less. I didn‚Äôt even have to be in Orlando for them to pick it up. They sent me a prepaid label for my title and I sent in the title, they let me know they received it and sent out my check. I deposited it and it went through and it‚Äôs been about a month now and I‚Äôm still so pleased with the easy service. I would do this again if needed.

"For the most part, I had a good experience. Most of the time, my questions were answered immediately and I was helped with any concerns. There were a few times my inquiries slipped through the cracks and I had to follow through to get answers. Also, I was told to go to the bank and ask for a document releasing the lien, but it turned out laws are different in California about titles, so the info I requested wasn't the correct info. Also, I had to be proactive about calling the bank because my representative couldn't reach them supposedly after several tries even though I was able to reach them the 1st time each time I called. So I had to do some extra step that I probably shouldn't have been required to do.",20 novembre 2019,5,part good experience time question answered immediately helped concern time inquiry slipped crack follow get answer also told go bank ask document releasing lien turned law different california title info requested correct info also proactive calling bank representative reach supposedly several try even though able reach 1st time time called extra step probably required

"My vehicle broke down and had to be towed to a car repair shop over an hour away from my home.

Once I enter the vehicle information and provided photos they provide me a price for buying my vehicle in a very timely manner.Once we agreed on the price CarBrain arraigned for my vehicle to be picked up and provided me a check at the time of pick up as advertised.Because my vehicle was at a car repair shop over an hour away coordination for the pick up was necessary with the designated towing company.

They did however get a tow truck to pick up the vehicle several hours late after I called when they did not show up. The tow company driver was very professional and diligent in reviewing the paperwork before accepting delivery of my vehicle and provided me with the agreed up on price once the vehicle was accepted.This process was so much easer, faster and hassle free than selling via Craig's list or Facebook I would have no issues using CarBrain in the future for selling a non running vehicle.",24 octobre 2019,5,vehicle broke towed car repair shop hour away home cost repair vehicle vehicule worth get towed home would also probability expensive looked several option selling vehicle part hesitant selling non running vehicle via internet carbrain enter vehicle information provided photo provide price buying vehicle timely manner agreed price carbrain arraigned vehicle picked provided check time pick advertised vehicle car repair shop hour away coordination pick necessary designated towing company however towing company unorganized show scheduled however get tow truck pick vehicle several hour late called show tow company driver professional diligent reviewing paperwork accepting delivery vehicle provided agreed price vehicle accepted process much easer faster hassle free selling via craig list facebook would issue using carbrain future selling non running vehicle

I am writing this review to make people aware that when you receive the check from the local agent (copart) that picks up your car and title you will not be able to cash it right away as you will be mislead into believing. You will have to hold the check at least 24 business hours to cash it. I went to the bank that the check was written on and there system told them to return the check to copart. After speaking to the manager I was able to keep the check because she had witness this before. When I called copart the lady I spoke to seemed to be bothered by my call. I have still not been able to cash the check but on Monday I will try again. PLEASE KNOW THAT WHEN IT SAYS YOU WILL GET YOUR CHECK THE SAME DAY THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CASH THAT DAY AND IF ITS A FRIDAY YOU MAY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL MONDAY.,10 mai 2019,5,writing review make people aware receive check local agent copart pick car title able cash right away mislead believing hold check least 24 business hour cash went bank check written system told return check copart speaking manager able keep check witness called copart lady spoke seemed bothered call still able cash check monday try please know say get check day able cash day friday may wait monday

I was assured by car brain that the next morning they would be dropping off my glasses and my check. I left instructions were to leave these items. All they left were my sunglasses because they didn't have the title because nobody passed the message on. Then I get a call from Carport basically giving me the riot act for not having a title. They're the ones that pretty much stole my car!He was threatening me.

Everything was done via texts, which made it very convenient given day-to-day challenges of going to a physical location. In less than a day, I sold my vehicle and received the check! I will caution though, the towing company who came didn't know how much to write the check out for, so I had to show him the email for confirmation. Initially, when I gave him the keys, he said thanks as if he had no intention of paying me, so I found that a bit odd. All in all, this was a great and seamless experience for me.

However overall it is a good company and they give you a fair price on your car even if it doesn't start anymore, and the towing is for free!

At 5:05pm, I called again and their phone line is dead. Their voicemail box is also full (what does that say?). I called CarBrain and their response is basically - Sorry, we cannot do anything.

"Started out a good, quick experience.  Set up to pick up the car the next morning.  When no one contacted me about the pickup I was told it would be sometime next week.  I explained this was unacceptable and set up a pickup for the next day.  Next day, no pickup.  When I called I was told that it wouldn't be until sometime next week.  I called carbrain and they said that they couldn't/wouldn't make any other arrangements.  I told them they obviously didn't want my business and I would find someone else who was more reliable.UPDATE:  After posting this review I received a call from the COO of Carbrain who said they would make this right and schedule a pickup on Tuesday morning (Monday was a holiday).  I agreed to give them another chance.  Fast forward to Tuesday morning.  I receive a call from a nice young lady who said she was going to schedule a pickup sometime this week.  I told her this was unacceptable and that I needed it picked up today.  She said she couldn't schedule ""same day"" pickup.

So, I had an 09 SUV that ran okay but it had a decent sized dent in the front, 180,000 miles and then the ignition cylinder decided to lock up so I couldn't even start it.  I knew it was time for a new vehicle and someone I knew told me they would ""take it off my hands"" for a small amount of money.  Then, I found Car Brain.  I was truly scared of the whole process.  Most was done via text between myself, Nancy and Delilah.  Send you a picture of my signed title?! Agree to hand over the title when they take my truck and not know if the check will clear?! WHAT?! I was nervous.  But, I rolled the dice anyway and could not be happier with the outcome.

I was given a window from 8am-12pm that my car would be picked up during. At 3pm that day, I called the company and asked what the deal was, as no one had showed up. They said they'd be there around 5pm, now. At 9pm we got the call that they were on their way. When we got there, they didn't have a the check--hadn't even realized that they owed me one. This didn't seem to be a problem with the tow company, but with communication between Carbrain and the tow.

"Our car died while driving on the highway and had to have it towed to a local shop. Turns out the engine blew. Didn't know what to do as couldn't leave the car at the shop indefinitely. Happened to do a search (can't remember what I typed) on the internet and found damagedcars.com. Clicked on get offer and put the car info, and it redirected to carbrain.com. I liked that it gave me an offer immediately without asking for my personal info. I got a chat from Nancy but wasn't ready yet to accept the offer. The next day talked to Nancy and asked if I can get more for the car. She was able to increase the offer and I accepted. In a few hours she has scheduled the tow. On the day of the tow, waited at the auto shop for the tow truck. I then realized we didn't remove the 6 CDs in the car and the battery is dead. Called Nancy and asked if it's possible for them to send the CDs to me, even if I have to pay for the shipping. She said she will request it. When the tow truck came, the driver had a blank check as he didn't read the instructions on the offer, so started filling out the check there. I gave the check a once over and seems all is good, and he left with the car. Went to the bank and while waiting for my turn, I noticed that the check requires 2 signatures if more than $1000. Called Nancy and told her the check is not valid as only 1 signature was present. She called the tow truck driver but he said he wouldn't be able to turn around. Nancy called the company that issued the check. The guy wanted me to send back the check and then he will send a new one. I told Nancy no, they need to send me a check asap. Nancy told the guy to do a stop payment on the check, and carbrain will send me a check and the guy can reimburse carbrain. Nancy said the check will be fedexed overnight so I should get it the next day. The next day I texted her but didn't hear back. Called her and no one answered, so was getting worried. Then I sent her an email, and finally, somebody returned my call. Turns out Nancy was off that day but she left instructions with accounting to overnight the check. So I did get the check the next day (whew!). I was so thankful that I worked with Nancy. She was very nice and very helpful with resolving the issue with the check. And she went above and beyond by getting the CDs returned to me. I received them a week or so later. I have recommended carbrain to everyone I know.

I was in a situation where my Lexus Hybrid needed repairs amounting to the trade-in value of the car. I was offered only enough to pay the towing bill by local salvage yards. I found Carbrains.com and received a more than generous offer that I accepted and was able to move on to a new car and am very happy with the process,22 ao√ªt 2017,5,situation lexus hybrid needed repair amounting trade value car offered enough pay towing bill local salvage yard found carbrains com received generous offer accepted able move new car happy process

I live in California and my vehicle was in Minnesota with my daughter. We had some mechanical problems with the car and needed to get rid of it. Damagedcars.com is based out of Florida and we took a leap of faith: they were extremely professional and kept their word.

"Nancy was great.  The offer was fair.  Once I accepted the offer I had my check the next day.  The only downside was that the towing company was supposed to call me the next day to arrange a time to pick up my car.   Instead, they showed up that evening while I was working with a customer which was extremely inconvenient.  There needs to be better communication between CarBrain and their towing service.  If it wasn't for that I would give 5 stars.",22 ao√ªt 2017,5,nancy great offer fair accepted offer check next day downside towing company supposed call next day arrange time pick car instead showed evening working customer extremely inconvenient need better communication carbrain towing service would give 5 star

I was skeptical about this at first but I had a very good experience with CarBrain.  I was assigned an agent and she worked me through the entire process.  The site is very user friendly and easy to use and she also texted me to help me complete the offer.  They did everything they said they would and brought a check upon retrieval of my car.  I would highly recommend.Great company!!!,18 ao√ªt 2017,4,skeptical first good experience carbrain assigned agent worked entire process site user friendly easy use also texted help complete offer everything said would brought check upon retrieval car would highly recommend great company

"The entire Process was pretty seamless.  I had my car breakdown and it needed a new engine.  The cost of the new engine was more than what the car was valued at.  I found Carbrain with a simple Google search, and was skeptical.  They offered me more money for my vehicle than anyone else that I spoke with; they even offered to tow away my vehicle at their expense.The only hiccup that I experienced (hence the 4 star rating) was coordination on pickup time with the tow truck.  I work 10 minutes away from the location my vehicle was at, and the tow truck driver didn't call ahead like he was supposed to.  The intent of this call was to allow me time to leave work and meet him to give him the title and keys. In the end the driver was very apologetic and it really did not amount to much frustration on my end, but I wanted to at least clarify why I gave 4 stars.I certainly hope that I never have a junk car again, but if I do I would definitely use these guys again.  I would also recommend them to anyone else.",08 ao√ªt 2017,5,entire process pretty seamless car breakdown needed new engine cost new engine car valued found carbrain simple google search skeptical offered money vehicle anyone else spoke even offered tow away vehicle expense hiccup experienced hence 4 star rating coordination pickup time tow truck work 10 minute away location vehicle tow truck driver call ahead like supposed intent call allow time leave work meet give title key end driver apologetic really amount much frustration end wanted least clarify gave 4 star certainly hope never junk car would definitely use guy would also recommend anyone else
